        <p>After the end of the year, the official commencement date. There will always be many opportunities in the new year, but it’s hard to say whether these opportunities are yours or not. However, there are always methods and laws. Laziness is human nature. It is the word laziness that brings many opportunities to ordinary people. Especially the beginning of the new year is your opportunity.<br>About laziness, I will directly talk about two points: 1. What is laziness like in life? 2. How to dig gold around laziness?</p>
<h3 id="1、-What-is-laziness-like-in-life"><a href="#1、-What-is-laziness-like-in-life" class="headerlink" title="1、 What is laziness like in life"></a>1、 What is laziness like in life</h3><p>Life needs to be plain and not plain. There are too many laziness in life, such as lazy boiling water, and the water dispenser helps you do it; Don’t bother to go out for dinner and have meituan takeout; Too lazy to read, there is Fandeng reading club; Lazy drainage, professional promotion company; Lazy mopping, intelligent mopping robots and so on, there are many, many lazy places, but it is because of these laziness that relevant opportunities and products have been born.<br>Therefore, no matter what happens, it has its two sides. What you see from different angles is different scenery. For ordinary people, laziness is not good. For entrepreneurs, the lazier the users, the better. In life, there are still many kinds of laziness. This is the opportunity. This will be the opportunity for you to increase your income in the new year. Don’t worry about what to do. When you can sort out 100 kinds of laziness in life, you will naturally know how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2、-How-to-dig-gold-around-laziness"><a href="#2、-How-to-dig-gold-around-laziness" class="headerlink" title="2、 How to dig gold around laziness"></a>2、 How to dig gold around laziness</h3><p>It is said that information gap is a business opportunity, which is true, but behind this information gap is the word laziness. Through laziness, we can always find many good projects and know the general direction. How can we dig for gold around this lazy word? In fact, as long as you have a heart, you will soon find that many cases have been made. What we need to do is to imitate these cases, copy and optimize them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Luminous balloon<br>When we go shopping, we can always see someone selling luminous balloons on the street. Children like it very much. A luminous balloon, about 6-10 yuan, feels acceptable, but we go to 1688 to search for it.<br>There are many similar, the wholesale price is about 1 yuan. At this time, interested people will come back from the wholesale website, wholesale some, and then go to places with a large flow of people to sell, selling 10 yuan each, 50 easy ones a night, with a profit of 7 yuan per balloon and 350 yuan, which is much better than going to work.</li>
<li>Accounting forms<br>Accounting is a profession specialized in accounting. The most frequent contact with this profession is a variety of statistical tables. If we say that every time we do account statistics, we need to make such a formatted form from scratch, it is also a troublesome thing.<br>Therefore, from the perspective of laziness, accountants need to find some ready-made style sheets to reduce the workload. Interested people collect and sort out a lot of accounting expressions through different channels, package and sell them.<br>Although it only sells for 1.98 yuan, it can’t afford a large amount. After that, this kind of virtual products often do the national market. They usually do a good job in drainage, and the profits are very rich. They are not restricted by logistics and collect money on the same day.</li>
<li>Plan<br>In the new year, when you start to work, you will always have to write some plans. The process from zero to some will be very big. Such a project operation plan<br>It also takes a lot of thought. At this time, laziness appeared again, so someone collected and sorted out the information of n-many relevant plans to sell<br>Sales are good. The people who organize make money, and the people who write the plan are lazy and successful. They have the best of both worlds.</li>
<li>Station B answer<br>I believe everyone has seen the video of station B. as long as you have registered its account, you will find that in order to successfully become a full member, you need to answer questions. To tell the truth, as long as you are patient, you can successfully answer questions and become a full member. However, there are a lot of people who are too lazy to answer questions, so someone began to sell products to help them do questions. This is also the demand derived from the users of station B who are too lazy to answer questions.<br>Through the above cases, we can find that as long as we can successfully find the laziness in life, we can create solutions. Laziness is the opportunity for us ordinary people. When you find 100 kinds of laziness, you have 100 opportunities to increase your income. You only need to choose what you like to do. In the later stage, you can directly refer to your opponents for how to drain and transform, because they have thought it out for you, so you just need to apply it. On the first day of the new year, I hope this article will inspire you.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</li>
