        <p>Yesterday, from the hot search list of microblog, I saw an interesting topic: what is high-quality sleep? When I opened it, I found that this topic was related to Gu ailing. She shared the secret of her success, that is, how to make her sleep for 10 hours every day.<br>As the saying goes, laymen watch the excitement while experts watch the doorway. A key word extracted from this topic is sleep, and a big demand derived from sleep is insomnia.</p>
<h3 id="01"><a href="#01" class="headerlink" title="01"></a>01</h3><p>Do so many people really have insomnia? I don’t count. That’s to be verified by big data. According to Baidu Index, the number of people who search for insomnia every day is about 3000-4000, and it has been so since 2011 and now 2022.<br>It can be seen that modern life is not easy. Due to various pressures, more and more people suffer from insomnia.<br>In order to confirm again whether there is a great demand for insomnia, search “insomnia” directly in Du Niang<br>Through the drop-down words, it is found that they are all the needs of poor sleep. What does this mean?<br>It’s very simple. It shows that a large number of people are searching for solutions in this field every day, otherwise they won’t appear in the drop-down box. Of course, if you want to solve insomnia, you must find a doctor. As ordinary people, of course, we are not doctors. Of course, we can’t solve the problem of insomnia for others. Most people think so. However, as marketers and entrepreneurs, we need more divergent thinking to consider. In fact, many times, we don’t need to completely solve the problem of insomnia. As long as we can alleviate it, there is a huge market.<br>There are many reasons for insomnia, such as cervical problems, promotion pressure, life difficulties, etc. insomnia caused by different reasons has given birth to corresponding products. Take the cervical vertebra problem as an example. The latex pillow was born. As long as you sleep, you can make the cervical vertebra more relaxed and comfortable and sleep better.</p>
<h3 id="02"><a href="#02" class="headerlink" title="02"></a>02</h3><p>Of course, for me, I prefer virtual products. What kind of virtual products can also improve sleep?<br>Its name is sleep music.<br>Maybe, many people don’t know that music can stimulate sleep. Let’s popularize science a little. One kind of music belongs to 432 Hz. This kind of music can heal the body and mind, let people get out of their emotions and make them more relaxed. When I am depressed, I will also listen to 432 Hz music, which can really make people empty.<br>In addition, according to the five elements and one theory left by our ancestors, the feather sound type also has the effect of improving sleep and nourishing the kidney.<br>The following is a general explanation of feather sound:<br>In order to derive whether there is a market for music assisted sleep, I conducted a relevant search in Du Niang, and someone was really advertising.<br>This shows that there is a special kind of people looking for this kind of music. When there is demand, the market is born, that is, opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="03"><a href="#03" class="headerlink" title="03"></a>03</h3><p>As ordinary people, how can we start this market?<br>Many times, we don’t need to tidy up. Many people have already done it. What we need to do is spend a little money to buy it. After we bought it, we sorted it out a little and easily had thousands of sleep music. The rest can be packaged into virtual products. Or you can put it into USB flash disk and sell sleep music USB flash disk. There are many examples, such as car music USB flash disk and so on.<br>A question + sleep music to help you. For example, users focus on what causes insomnia, so we can write a question or video about the causes of insomnia. Finally, plant insomnia music helps to improve the hook of sleep.<br>The title of the article can be: what causes insomnia? Sleep music helps you improve easily. For another example, the problem is insomnia, how to do? The title of the article is: what about insomnia? Sleep music helps you improve easily. In this way, the whole network is covered. Are you afraid of no traffic?<br>However, the problem actually comes from Baidu pull-down and 5118. When the traffic comes, it’s all loaded into wechat for transaction. OK, all the demands change and all the playing methods also change.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</p>
