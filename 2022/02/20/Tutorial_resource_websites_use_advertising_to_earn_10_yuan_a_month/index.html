        <p>Usually, it is almost impossible for a new site to get up in a few months if there is no high-weight old station to guide the external chain belt of the whole station. Of course, this refers to the means of white hat optimization. Is there a project that doesn’t need to rely on SEO websites to make money? The answer is yes, and such websites are also very profitable. They can earn more than 100000 yuan a month by simply receiving advertisements, which is comparable to color sites. What website is this?<br>The answer is tutorial sharing websites. At this time, someone will say that you just boast about X. In fact, the tutorial resource sharing websites I’m talking about here do not refer to those sites with VIP fees, but those completely free resource websites. Because these websites are free, users are usually very sticky. As long as you insist on sharing every day, these users will come every day and will be willing to take the initiative to help you promote.<br>Then you can earn 100000 a month for free? Don’t be kidding. Don’t worry. Let’s disassemble them one by one.<br>First of all, we can see that the website is full of advertisements, and according to my observation, the advertising space is full in a year. As for which website it is, I don’t say it here. I believe many people know which website it is. I went to know the advertising quotation about this website in advance. The following is a screenshot of the consultation.<br>Next, I can give you a screenshot of all the advertisements on this website.<br>Roughly, the advertising space alone earned 110000. At this time, it is estimated that someone will say that this website is the head. Only he makes so much money. In fact, it is not. As long as you search more, you will find that there are too many resource websites with full screen advertising. In addition to the advertising space, these websites also have another main way of making profits, that is, promotion. It is understood that the one-day IP of this website is about 50000-100000. We all know that a new promotion project comes out. It must be to see who grabs people first, and those who grab more eat meat. The rest may not even have soup. For example, take away CPS, Taobao customers, and even some mobile apps.<br>This project is so fragrant that I can’t let it go. After a period of testing, the website has hundreds of IP in the first month. How many pure white hat article sites can’t achieve in a year? At present, the IP that is stable at about 300 can occasionally go up to four or five hundred on weekends.<br>Now let’s share the operation process in detail.</p>
<h3 id="1、-Website-construction"><a href="#1、-Website-construction" class="headerlink" title="1、 Website construction"></a>1、 Website construction</h3><p>As for the construction of the website, it is recommended that you choose the program of zblog or WP. As for how to build the website, it is actually very easy. If you don’t understand, you can explore Baidu by yourself. There is not much explanation here. Of course, it is almost impossible for such websites to make money in the early stage, because you are completely free, mainly relying on the realization in the later stage. If you want to make money immediately in the early stage, you can consider making a charging resource station. The methods explained below are all general.</p>
<h3 id="2、-Resource-arrangement"><a href="#2、-Resource-arrangement" class="headerlink" title="2、 Resource arrangement"></a>2、 Resource arrangement</h3><p>If you want to make money from a resource website, it is a great test of your resource collection ability. How to collect it?<br>You can directly move peer resources, but peer resources generally have their watermarks. So it’s not recommended. Of course, as long as you look carefully, there are still some resource forums that don’t add website watermark, or their course watermark is easy to cover and won’t jump around. The second is to go to leisure fish or buy more resources. The third is to go directly to some Alibaba online disk resource forums. There is no recommendation here. You can search by yourself. According to my observation, there are still a lot of Alibaba online disk resource forums without watermark.<br>After you get these resources, all you have to do is download them, then add your website advertisements in the video or compressed package, and then upload them to the online disk to share. So how to add random jump watermark to the video? You can use PR or meeting sound and shadow here. However, these cannot be added in batch, which is a waste of time. Here is another artifact recommended to you, called EV video converter, but this one needs members. If it’s lifetime 188, the price is still very cheap. If you plan to be a resource station, you can consider buying one. After all, it can save you a lot of time.</p>
<h3 id="3、-Promotion-method"><a href="#3、-Promotion-method" class="headerlink" title="3、 Promotion method"></a>3、 Promotion method</h3><p>When your website is filled with certain content, you can start to promote it. After all, it takes a long time to get up by SEO, so we should take the initiative. How to promote it?<br>Is to add the resources of website advertising and distribute them to all corners of the Internet. How to do it? We go to Baidu search resources forum this keyword, and then find those forums that are not only posted by administrators, and then send them inside. After updating your website, you can synchronize to other resource forums immediately. In the early stage, as long as you can stand loneliness, you don’t need to be so tired after your daily IP comes up. Because at this time, netizens will take the initiative to help you promote, which may be to share or sell your resources, or recommend your website to his good friends. Of course, there are many channels. Let’s dig them out by ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="4、-Website-realization"><a href="#4、-Website-realization" class="headerlink" title="4、 Website realization"></a>4、 Website realization</h3><p>When you have a certain amount of traffic, you can consider cashing in. In fact, there are many ways to cash in. In addition to selling advertising and promotion projects, you can also set up a forum for netizens to exchange and share, and charge an invitation code. In addition, you can also open a public official account for Amway software. This time, you can directly send your official account to your website, and after all, you are sharing resources. Fans are still very accurate. The official account is official account. The public price is usually based on your reading. The 1 read 0.5-1 yuan. After reading the official account, there is a 1000 reading volume of a tweets after 10 thousand fans. In general, when you have thousands of powder in official account, people will continue to advertise for you. It is very easy to pick up 4 pieces a month, and that month will add 3000-4000 extra income. Of course, with the increase of your fans, the advertising quotation will naturally be higher and higher.<br>Author: Huang Bin official account: Huang Bin</p>
