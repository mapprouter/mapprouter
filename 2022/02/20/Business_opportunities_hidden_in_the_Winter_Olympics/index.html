        <p>These two days, the hottest event is the Winter Olympic Games. Even I, who usually doesn’t care much about winter snow sports, am also paying attention. Why? Because it’s very fresh, I haven’t seen many ice and snow sports. I don’t really want to go skiing. I haven’t experienced it. What kind of feeling is that. I believe most people, like me, are a little strange to ice and snow sports, but with the holding of the Winter Olympic Games, ordinary people like us gradually pay attention to ice and snow sports.<br>There are many opportunities derived from the Winter Olympics, take ice and snow sports for example. I believe that after the Winter Olympics, all ice and snow sports, some people began to try to learn, which is the germination of demand.<br>For example, at present, according to big data, the most popular sport is short track speed skating.<br>There is also a reason to be liked. What follows is that a large group of people want to learn short track speed skating. This prediction is not groundless, but supported by big data. According to Baidu Index analysis, nearly 100000 people are paying attention to this sport every day.<br>Before the Winter Olympics, about 3000 people were concerned every day. This shows that some people like this sport originally. With the holding of the Winter Olympic Games, this sport appears in front of more people, which also indicates that more and more people begin to try this sport. So where are our opportunities?<br>There are two ways:</p>
<h3 id="1-Direct-advertising-sales-tutorial"><a href="#1-Direct-advertising-sales-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="1. Direct advertising sales tutorial"></a>1. Direct advertising sales tutorial</h3><p>Ordinary people want to learn short track speed skating, and no one around them will. The best way is to find some information on the Internet to learn. At this time, we can sort out some information about short track speed skating collected on the Internet and pack it for sale.<br>There are many channels for collection, including existing books, videos and articles, which can be presented through the framework. Of course, there is still relatively little information about this movement on the Internet. Just because there is less information, you will have the first opportunity to do it. After all, all businesses are almost based on poor information. After finishing, we can complete a sales letter page like this and directly bid.<br>At the beginning, we haven’t reached the end of our psychology. We can set the sales price at 99 yuan. After the later sales are stable, we can slowly increase the price. This method is the most direct and simple. It can be effective immediately. The only thing that takes effort is to collect and sort it out.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-IP-long-term-operation"><a href="#2-Direct-IP-long-term-operation" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct IP long-term operation"></a>2. Direct IP long-term operation</h3><p>I personally prefer to do things with time compound interest. No matter what industry, it is suitable for vertical IP. We can output questions about short track speed skating through major we media platforms to obtain fans, such as:<br>These are a few questions I think of at random. One question is an article. You should know that there are at least tens of thousands of questions about short track speed skating. It is a process from scratch through the output of we media platform.<br>For example:<br>If we are in a classroom with 5 male students and 10 female students, the teacher asks us: what city is the capital of our country. This TM is a silly question. Everyone knows, but no one dares to raise his hand to answer. Why? Some people will think that the teacher’s question is definitely not so simple, while others will think “I’ll see if others raise their hands to answer”. At this time, you raised your hand to answer the question, the teacher praised you, and then you sat down. At this time, other students will certainly admire you. Why?<br>There are two reasons. One is to admire your courage. The other is that everyone knows that this knowledge has a sense of resonance. Many seemingly profound principles are actually a matter of one or two sentences. Doing IP is also a similar principle. Of course, we don’t need to focus on the sport of short track speed skating. We need to know that there are many ice and snow sports or other sports. If we find one we like and stick to it, we will certainly gain a lot.<br>Opportunities often come from life and attention. As serious as you are, the opportunities will be great.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</p>
