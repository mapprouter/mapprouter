          <p>According to techcrunch, Congo based start-up Jambo recently announced that it had raised $7.5 million in seed funds, including coinbase ventures, 3aC, Alameda research, tiger global, Delphi ventures, alliancedao, defiance capital, yield guild games, polygon studios, and some angel investors from Web3 ecosystem, For example, Sandeep nailwal, co-founder and CEO of polygon, Santiago r Santos, former parafi partner, do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of terrain labs and partners of Delphi digital piers kicks participated in this round of investment.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>The start-up company “Jambo” was founded in November 2021. They are committed to building “Web3 super application” in Africa and obtain income opportunities through the logic of “learning, playing and making money”. Some experts said that Southeast Asia has become one of the best markets of Web3, and Africa is about to be overturned by Web3. Startups such as axie infinity and yield guild games are located in Southeast Asia and have raised millions of dollars in venture capital. The combination of rapid population growth, stable smartphone penetration, increased adoption of cryptocurrency, low per capita GDP and high unemployment makes Africa the next mature place of Web3.<br>James Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Jambo, said that Jambo hopes to add millions of users to Web3 in Africa through its application. Similar to axie infinity and other guilds, users can only earn income when playing games in revenue sharing mode, while “Jambo” adopts a two-way approach, allowing its users to earn income when participating in web2 and Web3 activities.<br>For example, users can save data expenses when using “Jambo”. James Zhang explained that “Jambo” can get a discount of nearly 70% in cooperation with telecom suppliers and sell it directly to users at a discount of 50% of the original cost. “This is one of our main user acquisition strategies. We hope to double the call time and data of each African.”<br>Second, “Jambo” is working with social media companies, so users can earn tokens when viewing their content on their apps, which can be converted into cash income. “By working with these social media companies, we tokenize part of their advertising budget and provide it directly to end users,” James Zhang said.<br>In addition, James Zhang said that at present, there are no Web3 games from Africa that make money through games because of the lack of certain infrastructure. Jambo wants to build such infrastructure. Nevertheless, “Jambo” does not intend to take a share of users’ income. Instead, Jambo’s revenue will come from the web2 model - charging advertising fees and commissions by selling call time and data.<br>As the “gateway to Web3 in Africa”, James Zhang said that Jambo will test more than 10 games in the coming months to introduce its operation to users. “Education is at the heart of our work, because I don’t think there is a shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can consider making a profit at the end of the day or start acquiring users again, which is why we launch education courses on Web3,” he said.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>“Every component in our super app is actually designed to help ordinary people make money, such as watching videos to make money and save data expenses. So ideally, within three to six months after our app goes online, ordinary people can make $50 a month by playing axie infinity and another $20 a month by watching videos.”<br>“Jambo” is expected to release its beta version in the second quarter and officially launch in the third quarter. “What wechat has done in China,” Jambo “will also do in Africa. We are also pleased to support this a + team to become a Web3 super application on the African continent,” Web3 investor and former parafi partner Santiago r Santos said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Wen Silai yuan<br>Editor Su Jianxun<br>On February 21, Huawei released the latest wireless product solutions, mainly for operators, providing TDD third-generation massive MIMO products and FDD ultra wideband multi antenna series.<br>The so-called TDD (time division duplex) and FDD (frequency division duplex) refer to different information transmission modes. Huawei’s products released this time cover two modes, which will cooperate and eventually move towards “multiple frequencies and one network”.<br>Compared with the past, the third generation products can be configured with lower transmission power, reduce energy consumption by about 30%, and have a wider coverage. On the other hand, compared with the second generation products, the antenna array is nearly twice as many and the signal is stronger. The commercial FDD massive MIMO released by Huawei this time can increase the 4G network capacity by three times. If it is upgraded to 5g, the capacity can be increased by five times.<br>They also launched corresponding solutions for residential areas, urban hotspots and other scenes, which can be deployed by operators in a minimalist manner. This is also the only distributed m-mimo (large-scale multiple input and output technology) in the industry. Compared with 4t4r (four transmitting antennas and four receiving antennas), this scheme has a four times increase in network capacity, mainly for the demand of 5g in indoor scenes such as railway stations and shopping malls.<br>Operators have always wanted to have more products with large bandwidth and multiple antennas. Huawei has always been the industry leader in this technology. For a long time, mobile phones accounted for the majority of Huawei’s revenue. Now, operators and enterprise businesses will become the main body again.<br>According to Huawei’s financial report for the first half of 2021, in the first half of last year, Huawei’s consumer business fell 47% year-on-year, operator business fell 14.2% year-on-year, and enterprise business including Huawei cloud increased 18.2% year-on-year. It can be expected that compared with the steep decline of consumer business, operator business and enterprise business will become the key in the future.<br>Of course, the business of Huawei operators is also under pressure. Huawei 5g equipment has been abandoned in Europe. However, compared with mobile phone business, the decline of operator business will be relatively slow.<br>However, Huawei obviously continues to invest in 5g technology research and development. The products released this time also represent that Huawei will not give up 5g dividends. The next generation communication network is far from universal. At this time window, Huawei also hopes to build a deeper moat.</p>

          <p>This winter Olympics is not only a feast of sports, but also a feast of science and technology. The application of 5g, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other technologies fully demonstrates the power of science and technology and the concept of innovation. It is reported that a total of 212 technologies have been applied in the Beijing Winter Olympics, involving more than 60 subdivided application scenarios, of which 4 technologies are launched for the first time in the world and 33 technologies are used for the first time in the Winter Olympics.<br>Behind the opening and closing ceremonies and Winter Olympic competition facilities that amaze the world, it is inseparable from the technical support of many domestic science and technology enterprises. According to statistics, more than 70 enterprises have contributed to the Winter Olympics, including the opening ceremony, competition clothes, playground and so on.<br>In this article, the Hong Kong stock research society makes an inventory of the technical leaders behind the “black technology” of the Winter Olympics.</p>
<h3 id="Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast"><a href="#Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast" class="headerlink" title="Hard core technology helps visual feast"></a>Hard core technology helps visual feast</h3><p>First of all, one highlight of this year’s Winter Olympics is the “main torch”.<br>The seemingly simple torch has many scientific and technological elements behind it. The outer streamer, inner streamer and combustion system are jointly tackled by Aerospace Science and technology group, Harbin Institute of technology and Hart, printed by 3D technology, and assembled after post polishing.<br>The main torch uses hydrogen with green environmental protection and good flammability as fuel, realizing zero carbon emission of the torch in the history of the Winter Olympic Games. It has been burning over the bird’s nest from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony. Meijin energy, power source and Haohua technology are the main suppliers of hydrogen energy for the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the main torch, the special effects at the opening and closing ceremonies are also impressive.<br>At the closing ceremony, along with the melody of “me and you”, the five dreamy rings of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games rose slowly and intersected with the snowflake torch platform to connect the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in an innovative way to commemorate the “double Olympic moment”.<br>In the classic song “farewell”, 80 dancers walked slowly into the entrance. With the steps of the dancers, a picture of weeping willows gradually appeared. In the center of the site, countless green beams pass through the snowflake torch platform and reach the sky to form a big tree composed of beams.<br>According to Wang zhiou, visual effect director of the opening ceremony, in order to achieve realistic ice and snow effects, the opening and closing ceremonies use real-time capture, naked eye 3D, computer animation (CG), augmented reality (AR) and other technologies, which can be said to be a huge and complex digital innovation project.<br>In the fancy skills of the opening and closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, the LED large screen is indispensable. With a total area of 11626 square meters, the Winter Olympics led stage is currently the largest LED stage in the world.<br>The ground screen is jointly manufactured by listed companies lyade, BOE and Zhouming technology. Lyade provides more than 7000 square meters (the central part of the ground screen), and BOE and Zhouming technology provide about 4500 square meters (the semi arc parts on both sides of the ground screen). Among them, liad also undertook many LED display projects such as ice waterfall, ice cube, grandstand and playback system at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games.<br>In addition, in order to show the shocking light and shadow effect, the “true laser” display technology developed by Hangzhou Zhongke aurora is also adopted. This technology takes three primary color laser as the light source, and is the only display technology that can fully realize the latest international standard of bt.2020.<br>At the same time, in order to make the audience in front of the screen of more electronic devices better enjoy the Winter Olympics. Based on the 5g SA network of China Unicom, the 5g broadcasting equipment of the Olympic Broadcasting Service Company (OBS) Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony has realized the full scene mobile video live broadcast on the dedicated bearer channel, presenting the high-definition full scene of the Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony.<br>Before the opening ceremony, China Unicom specially designed for the “bird’s nest” and carefully created a 5g SA network with 300MHz bandwidth and full coverage without dead corners. During the opening ceremony, “bird’s nest” achieved the fastest rate of 1.5gbps downlink and 500mbps uplink, making the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games the largest and fastest network bandwidth in the history of the Olympic Games.<br>At the same time, the Winter Olympics also conducted a comprehensive cloud operation for the first time. According to the official microblog of the International Olympic Committee, the Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be broadcast globally through Alibaba cloud. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games will last about 1000 hours. The total production of broadcast content will reach 6000 hours, and will be broadcast in 4K Ultra HD format for the first time. Some important events will also be broadcast in 8K format.<br>This is another major technological progress since the satellite TV broadcasting of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games began. Olympic Broadcasting can reach billions of audiences around the world through the Olympic Broadcasting cloud supported by Alibaba cloud.</p>
<h3 id="The-most-special-“person”"><a href="#The-most-special-“person”" class="headerlink" title="The most special “person”"></a>The most special “person”</h3><p>In the Winter Olympics, in addition to Gu ailing, Su Yiming and other sports stars, some special “people” participated in the whole process, which was popular.<br>For example, a 22-year-old Beijing girl “Dongdong” served as the publicity official of Alibaba digital Winter Olympics.<br>In fact, she is a real-time virtual digital person driven by artificial intelligence. Backed by Ali artificial intelligence technology, she has real-life facial expressions and body movements, and has first-class delivery ability.<br>In addition to winter and winter, there is also a “anchor” with a higher appearance rate. She is the first AI sign language anchor to be built by Baidu Intelligent Cloud Xi Ling digital human platform. At the current Olympic Games, she served as the virtual anchor of CCTV news AI sign language, reporting the news of the Winter Olympic Games and broadcasting the event sign language live.<br>CCTV news AI sign language anchor appeared in the Winter Olympics. Compared with real people, she may have the hand speed of “fire shadow knot fingerprint”. Some netizens commented: “Mr. Zhu has found a sign language anchor who can fight in the first World War”.<br>Baidu intelligent cloud has built a large scale sign language action library, and has refined nearly 10 thousand sign language actions. The accuracy of the AI sign language anchors is 98.5%, which makes AI professional ability not lose the real person.<br>With the development of science and technology, virtual digital human has attracted more and more attention. Li Shiyan, head of Baidu Intelligent Cloud AI Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, believes that the number of people has not yet reached the scale industry, because digital human production technology threshold is high, the cycle is long, and the cost is high.<br>The Winter Olympics is a carnival feast for many digital people enterprises, but when digital people can be fully commercialized may need more waiting.<br>In addition to the virtual digital human, this winter Olympics, from smart venue construction to service guarantee, artificial intelligence and robot technology are widely used.<br>For example, on the first day of the torch relay of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the underwater robot held the torch tightly at the mouth of the ice cave with a mechanical arm, approached the amphibious robot, and completed the relay within 10 seconds.<br>In addition, the disinfection and cleaning robot is responsible for cleaning and disinfection to help the epidemic prevention in the competition area.<br>Epidemic prevention robots, guidance robots, logistics robots, cooking robots and other intelligent robots have made great contributions to the whole Olympic Games, and people look forward to their application in life.</p>
<h3 id="Winter-Olympics-“support-group”"><a href="#Winter-Olympics-“support-group”" class="headerlink" title="Winter Olympics “support group”"></a>Winter Olympics “support group”</h3><p>At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Chinese athletes won 9 gold medals through hard work. The smooth progress of the fierce competition is also inseparable from the support of a large number of technology companies inside and outside the stadium.<br>First of all, when it comes to the game, we should mention sportswear. The official Winter Olympics uniforms and equipment are provided by Anta. In order to help all participants keep warm from the cold, Anta used two self-developed fabric technologies - hot technology and waterproof and moisture permeable technology.<br>By locking the heat, blazing technology can effectively prevent the loss of heat from the human body. High quality innovative materials and rigorous technology can achieve super warmth in the severe cold environment. Among them, the three-dimensional thermal insulation material poly thermal cotton has the performance of light and heat storage, and the blocking effect of heat loss is increased by about 20%. It can rise in temperature instantly and store heat efficiently. The use of far-infrared graphene material can significantly improve the far-infrared irradiation temperature rise, more than double the national standard.<br>In addition, super down is attached with a nano protective layer, which is waterproof and moisture-proof. At the same time, it increases the fluffy degree by 30% compared with ordinary down, so as to give better play to the long-term thermal effect of down and super warm.<br>Secondly, in terms of venue energy supply, the wind energy from Zhangbei, Hebei Province was transmitted to the three competition areas and 26 venues of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, realizing 100% green power supply for the first time in history. Shuguang computing power, as the “wind protection messenger” behind it, uses the new generation of domestic computing platform of Shuguang to provide computing power for Zhangbei power.<br>Dawning’s new generation of domestic computing platform provides a total of large-scale computing support services in fields such as wind, solar and electric power, making it possible for green energy to be more widely used, and has good development prospects under the goal of “double carbon”.<br>Back on the field, in order to ensure the smooth holding of the Winter Olympic Games, China Unicom launched 5g smart ambulance.<br>Its emergence has realized the continuous, real-time and multi-party cooperative remote first aid of “Winter Olympic site emergency vehicle support hospital”. In short, the medical staff on the ambulance can return the relevant data and information in the vehicle to the emergency center in real time through the 5g network in the vehicle. Hospital experts can see a doctor remotely through ultra-high definition video to achieve remote guidance and other measures.<br>Finally, as the official ticketing service partner of Beijing Winter Olympic Games, barley has achieved the goal of fully realizing the digital operation of ticketing.<br>On the eve of the closing ceremony, Timo Rumei, director of the television broadcasting and market development department of the IOC, who is responsible for Olympic ticketing affairs, said that the Beijing Winter Olympic ticketing system is the first digital ticketing system in Olympic history.<br>According to the Hong Kong Stock Research Institute, the system is based on cloud computing and digital technology, adopts Cloud Architecture, supports the cross regional deployment of Alibaba cloud’s global network, and can accommodate tens of millions of users online in real time. At the same time, the Olympic smart ticketing system is connected with the cloud computing power at a high speed, which can transmit and calculate in real time, and support the digital operation of multiple scenes such as cross seat drawing, automatic seat allocation and intelligent report. The service efficiency is five times higher than that of the traditional ticketing system.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>The Winter Olympics can be held smoothly, and the supporting lineup behind it can be described as “a gathering of stars”.<br>In addition to the above companies, there are more enterprises that provide relevant services and facilities for the Winter Olympic Games. For example, smart bed supplier Qisheng technology provides “weightless bed”; Dafeng Industrial Company provides competition intelligent system integration and overall solutions for sports venues related to the Winter Olympic Games; Nanshan Zhishang company participated in the design of Winter Olympics cold proof clothing and multi-functional clothing; Jinhyundai company participated in the construction of Beijing Winter Olympic power operation guarantee command platform project.<br>At the just concluded 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we saw the application of a large number of cutting-edge technologies. Enjoy the “most scientific and technological” Winter Olympics.<br>Many enterprises providing technical support behind the Olympic Games have demonstrated their strong scientific and technological strength.<br>Perhaps in the near future, whether it is “people” such as virtual digital people and intelligent robots, or 5g, cloud computing and other related technologies, after leaving the Olympic stage, they will eventually become meta universe games, holographic projection conferences, virtual digital people anchors and so on into our daily life.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:ganggushe, which is authorized by 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>The current situation of Haidilao fully shows that “opportunity” can also become a crisis.</p>
<h3 id="Huge-loss"><a href="#Huge-loss" class="headerlink" title="Huge loss"></a>Huge loss</h3><p>“The current bitter fruit can only be swallowed by ourselves”. On November 5, 2021, Haidilao released the store closure plan and the “woodpecker plan”, how big is the expansion “bitter fruit”? At present, this “bitter fruit” is enough to make it return to before liberation and return the total net profit of the company in the three years before listing to zero.<br>On the morning of February 21, Haidilao issued a profit warning, saying that compared with the net profit of 309 million yuan in 2020, it is expected to have a net loss of 3.8 billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan in 2021; At the same time, the revenue in 2021 is expected to exceed 40 billion yuan, an increase of more than 40% compared with the revenue of about 28.6 billion yuan in 2020.<br>This is the first annual loss of Haidilao since its listing in 2018. Affected by this announcement, Haidilao’s share price fell by 5.54% on the same day and closed at HK $19.08, a decrease of nearly 80% compared with the high of HK $85.80 in February last year, and the market value evaporated by about HK $350 billion.<br>For the gap between revenue and net profit, Haidilao said in its announcement that it was mainly caused by two reasons:<br>First, the one-time loss and impairment loss on the disposal of long-term assets caused by the closure of more than 300 restaurants and the decline of restaurant operating performance in 2021 totaled about RMB 3.3 billion to RMB 3.9 billion;<br>Second, the impact of global continuous changes and repeated epidemics, the rapid expansion of store network in 2020 and 2021 and the company’s internal management problems on the operation of Haidilao restaurant; Especially in the second half of 2021, the operation of Haidilao restaurant was significantly affected by the global regional epidemic outbreak and public health control measures, and its operating performance decreased compared with the second half of 2020. Overseas stores also experienced increased losses in 2021.<br>Although the impact of the epidemic has been mentioned many times in the announcement, it can be seen that the main cause of the performance loss of Haidilao is strategic error. In the first half of 2020, affected by the strictest epidemic situation and control, Haidilao lost 965 million yuan in net profit. After the recovery in the second half of the year, it turned loss into profit and gained 309 million yuan in net profit for the whole year. With the further relaxation of domestic epidemic control, if we follow the normal rhythm, the net profit in 2021 will increase on the basis of at least 309 million yuan. Why is there a serious loss?<br>The problem lies in contrarian expansion. Blind self-confidence, misjudgment of the epidemic situation, coupled with the temptation of preferential rent policies for shopping malls and properties, Haidilao “went against the trend and opened 544 new stores and restaurants when its performance was greatly impacted by the epidemic in 2020; In the first half of 2021, it continued to implement the aggressive expansion strategy and opened 299 stores. As of June 30, 2021, the total number of global stores of Haidilao was 1597.<br>The expansion of stores brought about a significant increase in costs and expenses, but the turnover rate and the average daily sales of the same store decreased one after another, and the company increased revenue without increasing profits. After realizing the problem, Haidilao decided to slow down and put a sharp brake on it, closing 300 stores in succession in the second half of the year. Between opening and closing, the impact is not just the change in the number of stores. The one-time loss and impairment loss are as high as about 3.3 billion yuan to 3.9 billion yuan, accounting for 87% of the total estimated loss in 2021.<br>It is worth mentioning that in the first half of 2021 alone, Haidilao also obtained a net profit of 94.529 million yuan, that is, the estimated loss of 3.8-4.5 billion yuan was generated in the second half of the year.<br>Compared with its financial reports in previous years, from 2018 to 2020, Haidilao’s net profits were RMB 1.646 billion, RMB 2.345 billion and RMB 309 million respectively, totaling about RMB 4.3 billion. It can be said that once it returned to before liberation, it lost the net profits of the three years before listing in half a year. It has to be said that Haidilao’s counter trend expansion had a “bad effect”.</p>
<h3 id="hemostasis"><a href="#hemostasis" class="headerlink" title="hemostasis"></a>hemostasis</h3><p>In order to stop the loss in time, Haidilao adopted the strategy of “breaking the arm to stop bleeding”, launched the “woodpecker plan” on November 5, 2021, and closed more than 300 stores with poor performance before December 31, 2021, some of which are “suspended”, and will wait for the opportunity to reopen in the future, with a rest cycle of no more than two years; Rebuild and strengthen some functional departments and restore the regional management system; Timely shrink the group’s business expansion plan. If the average turnover rate of the group’s restaurant is lower than 4 times a day, in principle, new Haidilao restaurant will not be opened on a large scale.<br>Comparing the financial report data of four years after listing, we can see that the turnover rate of Haidilao is not ideal: in the first half of 2021, the turnover rate of Haidilao is three times a day, and from 2018 to 2020, the turnover rate is five times a day, 4.8 times a day and 3.5 times a day respectively, which has decreased for four consecutive years. The “woodpecker plan” refers to no less than four times a day, which means that it is difficult to return to the level before the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020 in the short term.<br>While Haidilao squatted down to “tie their shoelaces”, houlang changed the slow pace in the past and accelerated the pace of expansion. Among them, Guangdong style hotpot Laowang and Seafood Hotpot Qixin tianxiangji submitted prospectuses to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September 2021 and January 2022, intending to compete for the “third share of Hong Kong stock hotpot”. Both sides put forward ambitious expansion plans in the prospectus. According to the prospectus, as of the third quarter of 2021, the number of Qixin Tianmen stores was 250, and it is planned to open another 300 new stores in the three years from 2022 to 2024; At present, Laowang, which has less than 200 self operated stores, will also usher in a high outbreak period of stores, and plans to open 227 new stores in the next three years.<br>At the same time, like Haidilao, Banu Maodu hot pot, which belongs to Sichuan hot pot and is also positioned as a high-end hot pot, won a large amount of financing of more than 500 million yuan in June 2021, followed by Chongqing hot pot brand “elder martial brother Zhou” and elder sister Pei hot pot. Although there is still a certain gap between the above brands and Haidilao in terms of volume and brand value, with the blessing of capital, they are eroding Haidilao’s market share and diluting its advantages.<br>Among them, Banu was a “follower” of Haidilao in its early days. Later, it occupied a place in the field of high-end hot pot with its own product and service advantages. At present, there are only about 85 Direct stores in China, and the customer unit price is dozens of yuan higher than Haidilao, but the grand situation of queuing in its stores in various cities is very similar to Haidilao in its early years, and its prospect is also optimistic by the industry.<br>According to Shen Boyuan, a consumer consulting expert, it is necessary for Haidilao to stop and rest at this time. The implementation of the “woodpecker plan” is correct and necessary. He said: “at present, the hot pot market still has a certain growth space, and Sichuan hot pot is one of the most popular categories. Haidilao is still the first leading brand. The top priority is to revitalize its own service advantages and improve its internal management level. As long as it operates lean, there is still a great opportunity to regain the market.”<br>Of course, the operation of any enterprise is not smooth sailing. Many successful chain catering brands have experienced crises, and each crisis is a turnaround to a certain extent. Successful resolution will be a qualitative leap for enterprises.<br>After nearly 20 years of development, Haidilao has established a mature supply chain, products, management service system and brand value. These core assets give it the ability of sustainable development and are a solid guarantee for its breaking journey. It will take some time to verify whether the “woodpecker plan” can finally get Haidilao out of the dilemma and return to the peak. We might as well be more patient.<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:fbc180, author: Li Huanhuan, 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>The business of cross-border e-commerce is becoming more and more lively.<br>Recently, the official website of damonstudio, a cross-border women’s clothing independent station under byte beat, announced that damonstudio will stop operation from February 11, 2022. At this time, it is only more than three months since its domain name registration.<br>Damonstudio was founded against sheen, which has become a model for Internet giants to emulate since the cross-border e-commerce Unicorn sheen became popular all over the world. In addition, the company also expanded tiktok’s e-commerce team on a large scale in 2021, and launched the Independent E-commerce application Fanno overseas.<br>The overseas e-commerce road of byte beating reveals uncertainty and needs to continue to wait and see. However, during the same period when dmonstudio announced its shutdown, more players were eager to try.<br>On February 15, according to Xinyan finance, wechat recently tested a cross-border e-commerce applet “cloud shopping around the world” to try to connect overseas businesses with wechat users; On February 16, Reuters reported that sheen is actively expanding its Singapore office and has changed its actual holding company to Singapore company roadget business PTE.<br>After more than ten years of development, the hot land of cross-border e-commerce has gathered Internet giants such as Alibaba, jd.com and byte beat, giving birth to unicorns, listed enterprises and countless hot money.<br>Favorable policies are introduced frequently. Since the Announcement No. 56 and 57 issued by the General Administration of Customs in 2014, the support of national and industrial policies has been increasing in the next few years.<br>At the beginning of 2022, cross-border e-commerce ushered in good news again - 27 new cross-border pilot zones will be established across the country, and the policy dividends will continue to be released.<br>However, with the support of all parties, the cross-border e-commerce field has not ushered in players who break through the siege. It was not until the birth of sheen in recent two years that a player who could tear a hole in the territory of e-commerce giant Amazon really appeared.<br>At the same time, in 2022, the rising cost of raw materials and the reduction of logistics efficiency of cross-border e-commerce continue. In the United States, India and other places, players will still be seriously affected by geography.<br>On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises, of which express was included for the first time.<br>How to eat the trillion cake of cross-border e-commerce in 2022?</p>
<h3 id="01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage"><a href="#01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage" class="headerlink" title="01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage"></a>01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage</h3><p>Internet giants’ exploration of cross-border e-commerce can be traced back to more than a decade ago.<br>At that time, with the gradual saturation of the domestic e-commerce industry, Internet giants invariably turned their attention to overseas markets.<br>Ali founded the online wholesale trading platform for the global market - Express in 2010, and wholly acquired American Vendio company to connect with express; JD’s cross-border exploration began in 2011, successively opening JD English station, Russian station and Spanish station to enter the overseas e-commerce market.<br>Before Alibaba founded express, domestic cross-border e-commerce experienced early development and realized a complete online transaction chain of transaction, payment and logistics. Lanting Jishi, Milan and other well-known cross-border e-commerce platforms have sprung up.<br>Lanting Jishi sells by self built stations, which is very similar to the independent station mode promoted later, while the opposite is the platform mode. The platform does not participate in the purchase and sales of goods, but the medium of transaction.<br>Lanting Jishi was listed in US stocks as early as 2013 and became the “first share of China’s cross-border e-commerce”. At that time, the development focus of most Chinese e-commerce enterprises was still at home, and the overseas e-commerce businesses of Alibaba and JD were also challenged.<br>In 2012, when Jingdong English station went online, Shi Tao, vice president of Jingdong Mall, once announced that it would achieve $100 million in Jingdong’s overseas business within three years, but after three years, Jingdong English station still didn’t improve. In the same period, Alibaba express was busy with the transformation, officially turning from C2C to B2C.<br>In the vast overseas, there is not much room for the development of Chinese enterprises. In 2009, the Sino US trade conflict began to take shape. In contrast, the European market has a relatively stable political environment and high consumption capacity, which is suitable for Chinese enterprises to achieve the goal of going to sea. This year, Lanting Jishi began to launch European sites, and a large number of enterprises began to pour into Europe. However, it is worth noting that at that time, high-end consumer markets such as Europe and the United States were mostly controlled by head players such as Amazon.<br>Chinese enterprises can only avoid the sharp edge of leading players such as Amazon and open up emerging markets in countries such as Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.<br>In recent years, cross-border e-commerce has flourished. According to Analysys data, the proportion of cross-border e-commerce in total foreign trade has increased year by year, from 15.71% in 2017 to 22.03% in October 2021. From January to October 2021, the scale of cross-border e-commerce industry reached 6.98 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 25.47%.<br>However, although the cross-border e-commerce industry has experienced a dividend period of rapid development and an elimination period of fierce competition in the past decade, the market is still savage.<br>For a long time, the services of those platforms that seem to be successful are not mature. The distribution timeliness of overseas e-commerce was once very backward. Sellers were used to “selling winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter”.<br>It was not until recent years that Chinese e-commerce enterprises began to expand their business scope. Expand from overseas warehouses and third-party warehouses to self owned logistics networks and cross-border e-commerce industrial parks, rather than focusing on online sites as in the early days. The delivery time has been much faster, but it has only been delivered within 7 days to “72 hours” in a few urban areas.<br>The multinational home-based restrictions under the influence of the epidemic in 2020 once led to the outbreak of online sales. However, after 2021, behind a series of events such as “one container is difficult to find” of port containers, cross-border e-commerce has experienced the phenomenon of rising costs of logistics, raw materials and tariffs, difficulties in customs clearance and inspection, and reduced logistics efficiency. The difficult situation of small and medium-sized sellers has also slowed down the growth of the platform.<br>Geopolitical influence is also intensifying. On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises. In addition to including express for the first time, Dunhuang, a cross-border e-commerce platform, was “named” again this year. The impact is not limited to the United States. There have been media reports that Ali’s international business in India is still shrinking.<br>After a long time of model exploration, the road of overseas e-commerce of giants is still difficult and far from reaching the harvest period.</p>
<h3 id="02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode"><a href="#02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode" class="headerlink" title="02 “second spring” of independent station mode"></a>02 “second spring” of independent station mode</h3><p>Independent station is nothing new, but it still rises rapidly in 2020 and continues to be hot in 2022, attracting giants and capital to bet.<br>Sheen, which started in Ningbo, became a blockbuster and became the most installed shopping app in the United States by surpassing Amazon. The rise of sheen is inseparable from its flexible supply chain system, social media marketing ability and China’s tax relief for cross-border e-commerce.<br>It is worth noting that sheen is an independent ecological station.<br>According to Bloomberg, sheen achieved $10 billion in sales in 2020, a year-on-year increase of more than 250%. In this ecosystem, only one of them can achieve an annual revenue of 10 billion US dollars.<br>This also means that the ecology of the independent station has not been fully reclaimed.<br>The rise of independent stations is closely related to the progress of SaaS station building system technology. The construction threshold and cost of the website are reduced, so that sellers can realize the most basic website construction for thousands of yuan. By selecting more third-party plug-in services, sellers can also obtain services at a low cost.<br>This year, the field of cross-border e-commerce SaaS is still developing rapidly. In January 2022, JD group announced its cooperation with Shopify. JD will open a commodity pool based on JD supply chain network for Shopify global merchants through DTC independent station. It can be seen that SaaS tools support cross-border e-commerce platforms. In the same month, the global e-commerce independent station SaaS platform shopkeeper technology announced that it had completed a C1 round of financing with a total amount of US $150 million, which was led by Softbank vision phase II fund. In the past two years, cross-border e-commerce SaaS service providers have also continued to be hot.<br>Compared with the threshold and cost, what can attract sellers more is the private domain traffic created by independent stations. At present, mainstream platforms such as Amazon and express are gradually crowded, with fierce competition among sellers, difficult access to public domain traffic and high cost.<br>A large number of cross-border e-commerce platforms are attacking cities and territories with the main low price strategy, which also leads to the pressure on their revenue and profits. When they encounter market changes, these platforms are also the first to be affected. Last November, vova, known as “European pinduoduo”, encountered tens of thousands of sellers to protect their rights because of “running away”.<br>For sellers, independent stations still have dividends, which is more likely to give birth to the story of “sudden wealth”.<br>Overseas short video social platforms can also guide these sites. In particular, the rise of new traffic platforms such as tiktok has increased the traffic channels of overseas sellers.<br>However, these traffic platforms may also have their own “ideas”. From tiktok e-commerce to dmonstudio and Fanno, we have never given up the business of cross-border e-commerce. At the end of last year, Zhang Yiming mentioned in his internal objectives that further exploration will be focused on three new business directions in 2021, including cross-border e-commerce.<br>Not only tiktok, Facebook’s exploration in the field of e-commerce has never stopped. When social media starts to make e-commerce layout, with strong users as the basis of e-commerce business, it is difficult for those independent station players not to have a sense of crisis.<br>No one can predict whether the independent station is the end of cross-border e-commerce or just a small stone to the market. The development of independent station mode still needs to wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future"><a href="#03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?"></a>03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?</h3><p>Chinese players want to attack the cross-border e-commerce market. Their biggest opponents are not only Amazon and other players who occupy the market, but also the dramatically changing overseas market environment. How to overcome obstacles and win overseas is still a difficult problem.<br>The rapid development of live e-commerce overseas has shown players a new way.<br>The development of overseas live broadcast e-commerce is relatively late. In 2019, Amazon launched the live broadcast function. Last year, social platforms such as Facebook and instagram launched live delivery. This year, Amazon and other e-commerce giants, Facebook and other social media are still overweight live e-commerce.<br>As the market is still in its infancy, the development of live e-commerce business of local giants is also relatively slow, which is an opportunity for Chinese players.<br>At present, Kwai Tong and TikTok have begun the layout of overseas direct seeding providers, and the fast hands also say that they will accelerate the development of live broadcasting business overseas.<br>However, this road is not so easy. Tiktok rarely mentioned live data. Foreign media reported that tiktok had conducted two live shopping activities with Wal Mart, but the viewing data was not ideal.<br>On the one hand, overseas users are not familiar with the mode of live shopping. On the other hand, the current common dilemma of cross-border e-commerce is that it relies on popular single products to promote sales, and the brand attribute is secondary, which also leads to the difficulty of selecting products for live shopping.<br>Previously, in the best-selling list of Amazon and express, the old and new products changed quickly, while most of the products at the top had no brands, so they were easy to be replaced and eliminated.<br>This is also the embodiment of these platforms chasing category dividends. Compared with product capabilities, they rely more on operation means. In the long run, cross-border e-commerce platforms should strengthen brand attributes while building explosive products.<br>In addition, in the field of e-commerce, business flow and logistics are indispensable.<br>In recent years, China’s logistics enterprises are also speeding up going to sea. In 2021 alone, most players entered the game.<br>In May 2021, Zhongtong international realized that the normal time limit for customs clearance and delivery in Yangon, Myanmar was “72 hours”, and the whole territory distribution was an additional day; At the end of June, Yuantong International’s freight routes were expanded to East Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan, and South and Southeast Asian countries such as Pakistan; In September, SF holdings completed the acquisition of 51.5% equity of Kerry Logistics; In October, Baishi joined hands with Changhong to explore the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia.<br>Their participation can provide the underlying logistics foundation for the cross-border e-commerce platform. In addition, the cross-border e-commerce platform itself also pays close attention to building a global logistics network, so as to provide strong support for the development of overseas e-commerce business.<br>An earlier batch of cross-border e-commerce companies have begun to build their own overseas warehouses. Although this will cause enterprises to spend a lot of costs and occupy a lot of working capital, once the overseas warehouses become large-scale, it will help the platform strengthen the supervision of merchants’ product quality, and ensure the reliable source of products when cooperating with brands. More importantly, it will also greatly reduce the logistics time.</p>
<h3 id="04-ending"><a href="#04-ending" class="headerlink" title="04 ending:"></a>04 ending:</h3><p>After more than ten years of development, cross-border e-commerce is far from the end, and the fierce competition has not abated. From drainage, supplier development, to operation, logistics and services, each link is testing the cross-border e-commerce platform, not to mention more uncontrollable factors.<br>However, for Chinese players, we have a first mover advantage in new models such as live e-commerce. In the past, as a world factory, China has caught up with the upsurge of intelligent manufacturing, and more and more new categories, brands and products can be exported overseas.<br>I believe that given more patience and time, more giants from China will be born in the field of cross-border e-commerce.<br>This article is from WeChat official account “Zhang Dongwei” (ID:zhangdongwei19750613), author: Zhang Dongwei, 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>From the end of 2021 to the beginning of 2022, in addition to Qualcomm Xiaolong 8 Gen 1 becoming the talk capital of digital enthusiasts after dinner, ltpo, a relatively unfamiliar “word”, was also repeatedly put on the table. In addition to having enough voice among geeks, mobile phone brands even talked about this technology in equal length with performance at several press conferences at the end of the year.<br>On the stage, manufacturers are in high spirits to publicize the “power saving” advantages of mobile phones after their adoption of ltpo technology.<br>Under the stage, consumers will still face various problems of power consumption, jamming and battery life when using Android phones.<br>Ltpo is to reduce unnecessary power consumption by “adaptive” refresh frame rate while maintaining high screen refresh, so as to achieve the purpose of power saving.<br>However, the ideal is full and the reality is skinny.<br>On the one hand, mobile phone manufacturers have different scheduling for third-party app software. If they make good software scheduling by using ltpo characteristics, they can indeed reduce some power loss of mobile phones in specific scenarios; But if it is not done well, it will not only consume electricity, but also increase the sense of visual fragmentation, which is equivalent to a double-edged sword.<br>In addition, if you want to perfectly adapt the third-party app, manufacturers need to spend a lot of energy. After all, the number base of commonly used software is huge, and the characteristics of each software are different. Where to reduce the frame rate, where to maintain high refresh, how to switch the frame rate of the secondary and tertiary switching interface, how to minimize the sense of cleavage, and so on, all need to be deeply adapted.<br>On the other hand, for game scenes where large power consumers need to maintain a high refresh frame rate, ltpo can play a very limited role.<br>Why can various mobile terminal manufacturers still carry out crazy publicity like ltpo as a baby? Even ltpo has not become the standard configuration of mobile phones. Ltpo 2.0 came. It seems that without ltpo, it is not enough for the flagship mobile phone standard.</p>
<h3 id="Where-is-the-ltpo-artifact"><a href="#Where-is-the-ltpo-artifact" class="headerlink" title="Where is the ltpo artifact?"></a>Where is the ltpo artifact?</h3><p>Users interested in screen display technology should be familiar with the current mainstream screen materials. At present, the mainstream screen materials are OLED and LCD. These two screens have their own advantages and disadvantages in mobile terminals.<br>No matter LCD or OLED, all mobile terminal manufacturers have long regarded screen refresh as the main selling point. In this new equipment track, the higher the screen refresh rate, the more able anyone can occupy the high-end voice.<br>However, the following problem is that if you always maintain a high refresh rate, the pressure on the processor and battery load are problems. How can you not only ensure the refresh rate, but also reduce unnecessary power loss and make the mobile phone more power-saving?<br>Screen material pictures from the network<br>Dynamic refresh may be the key “method” to solve this problem. Let the screen respond to “on-demand changes” according to the user’s use scene. For example, when playing a movie, it can be displayed in 24 frames; When reading books or comics, 1 frame is displayed; When sliding the page, it can run in 60 frames or even 120 frames.<br>At this time, ltpo appeared, which is fully called “low temperature polycrystalline oxidation”.<br>In fact, it can not be regarded as a new technology. Apple watch 4 has taken the lead in adopting variable refresh screen, which can be instantaneously increased from constant 1Hz to 60Hz when waking up.<br>Both Apple watch 5 and apple watch 4 support ltpo. Pictures are from Apple’s official website<br>Ltpo is a “hybrid” solution applied to OLED TFT backplane. To understand this technology, we must first talk about the mainstream TFT backplane technology.<br>At present, TFTs used in portable devices mainly include a-Si, LTPS and igzo. A-Si is called amorphous silicon. Because of its low cost and high yield, this material is widely used in mobile screen display, covering high, medium and low price products in the early stage. However, the carrier mobility related to the advantages and disadvantages of TFT and display power consumption is only 0.3-1 cm ²&#x2F; V · s (the higher the data, the more power saving).<br>With the upgrading of technology iteration and consumer demand, low-temperature polysilicon materials are slowly moving towards the main stage, namely LTPS. In addition to the power consumption advantage brought by high mobility and reduced driving voltage, the response speed is also fast, but the yield is low and the cost is high, which limits the large screen equipment to carry this technology.<br>It is necessary to mention promotion on iPad pro. This product does not use LTPS material, but igzo with carrier mobility of only one tenth of the former. On the one hand, due to cost considerations, on the other hand, due to the characteristics of igzo itself, its leakage is also better than LTPS, and the refresh rate is more stable.<br>As the name suggests, ltpo is a technology that forms oxide layer on LTPS layer through a series of technologies. It not only has the characteristics of high mobility and low power consumption of LTPS, but also has the characteristics of low refresh stability and low leakage of igzo. In a simple analogy, ltpo is equivalent to combining the advantages of the two materials.<br>In addition, public research data show that ltpo can reduce the power consumption of terminal equipment by 5% - 15%. Although the paper data is beautiful, it actually depends on the specific use scenario. For the power consumption without the use scenario, it is of little significance to users.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-ltpo-and-what-is-ltpo-2-0"><a href="#What-is-ltpo-and-what-is-ltpo-2-0" class="headerlink" title="What is ltpo and what is ltpo 2.0"></a>What is ltpo and what is ltpo 2.0</h3><p>At present, the change of ltpo 2.0 in hardware technology is not obvious. “2.0” emphasizes more like “optimization” for different use scenarios. In other words, ltpo 2.0 may make users feel ltpo technology. Different from the “unified caliber” of various manufacturers when ltpo first came out, ltpo 2.0 is more like the product of “in-depth customization”, which can be understood as the technology after hardware + software optimization.<br>If different frequencies are displayed in different scenes, such as running at 120 frames when brushing microblog; When watching a movie, it runs at 24 movie standard frames; When reading articles, it is not difficult to display them in 10 frames or less.<br>Liu fengshuo microblog picture from microblog<br>The difficulty is how to balance the scheduling frame rate when displaying content and touching fingers.<br>Each company’s frame rate scheduling logic for ltpo 2.0 is different. On the 12 series, Xiaomi will not only dynamically adjust the refresh rate in different scenes in the conventional application, but also realize sliding speed change according to the speed of the finger sliding the screen. The one plus ltpo 2.0, according to them, is the real ltpo 2.0.<br>Liu fengshuo of Yijia also said on his microblog: “it’s not a thing. In addition to being customized with Samsung, Yijia’s ltpo 2.0 includes a large number of self-developed technology applications, which makes the screen experience a new height in many aspects”.<br>Yijia pointed out that the current problem encountered by ltpo is that the recognition of complex superimposed scenes is low and the matching speed is not fast enough. For example, typing scenes are used every day in daily life. Generally, the system will detect that this is a “typing” requirement, so it will increase the frame rate to 120 frames, but the problem is that it does not need to be maintained at 120 frames all the time. With the advantage of ltpo 2.0, it can dynamically adjust the number of frames according to the screen display content while detecting the scene, increase the frame rate to a high frame rate at the moment of typing and reduce it to 1 frame at the moment of leaving.<br>The refresh rate pictures under different applications of Xiaomi come from Xiaomi<br>However, in this millisecond, can the additional power consumption reduced be really perceived?<br>According to the friends around us and the measured data, the equipment using ltpo 2.0 does not save much power. In addition, it is not difficult to see from the measured data in the rice evaluation of digital bloggers that there is no gap between the models equipped with ltpo and ordinary mobile phones in terms of endurance.<br>The picture comes from the screenshot of rice evaluation video<br>Rice said in the ltpo 2.0 evaluation: “from the perspective of power saving, ltpo does a good job. To a certain extent, it does save power, but there is still a big question mark on how much this part of power consumption improves the overall life of the mobile phone.”. For some heavy mobile game players, the cliff like decline of power can be intuitively experienced.<br>Whether it’s ltpo or lpto 2.0, it’s in a “sleep” state when facing the game scene.</p>
<h3 id="Is-the-gospel-of-deep-game-lovers-an-independent-display-chip"><a href="#Is-the-gospel-of-deep-game-lovers-an-independent-display-chip" class="headerlink" title="Is the gospel of deep game lovers an independent display chip?"></a>Is the gospel of deep game lovers an independent display chip?</h3><p>Mobile phone brands such as black shark and iqoo, which are deeply loved by heavy mobile game players, have “found a new way” to achieve the purpose of “reducing power consumption” by adding hardware, that is, an independent display chip is built in the mobile phone.<br>In fact, this is not to install “independent display chip” in mobile phones after the large-scale popularization of smart phones.<br>As early as 2007, NVIDIA launched geforce 5500 for mobile phones, which can realize high-specification video decoding, support high-resolution and 3D game performance, but it failed to give full play to the strength of this chip due to the function and game software support.<br>Black Shark mobile phone 2 Pro picture from black shark official website<br>Therefore, this business strategy soon ended in failure.<br>Today, 15 years later, mobile games are developing rapidly. High capacity, high image quality and multiple people on the same screen are a major trend, which is a big test for the current mobile phone performance. When running games such as original God and call of duty mobile game version, the mobile phone processor is often required to “run under full load”, which brings additional heat and battery loss to the mobile phone.<br>How to ensure high refresh while reducing load loss is the biggest headache for mobile phone manufacturers. At this time, independent display chips come in handy.<br>Taking iqoo 9 Pro as an example, the function principle of high frame and low power consumption mode is to double the overall number of frames by only rendering half the number of frames by GPU, and then inserting frames. For example, rendering 45 frames to achieve 90 frames and 60 frames to achieve 120 frames. This can not only improve the picture fluency, but also make the mobile phone in a low load state. The mode of increasing the frame rate is to insert one frame into the two pictures of the low frame game to enhance the fluency on the original basis.<br>The independent display chip is mainly used in mobile phones to improve the frame rate<br>Judging from the recent launch of the flagship new machine equipped with Qualcomm 8, some manufacturers have begun to adopt the dual hardware configuration of ltpo + independent display chip. In the public use scenario, the ltpo mechanism is used to achieve the purpose of power saving; In the entertainment scene, the independent display chip is used to further reduce the power consumption.<br>Iqoo 9 Pro is a flagship machine rarely using ltpo and independent display chip<br>This seems to be one of the few “hard core” ways to improve the endurance performance of mobile phones.<br>Unfortunately, the screen resolution of ordinary scenes can be adjusted adaptively, and the GPU load of game scenes can be reduced, but the Android GPU is still running at a high speed.<br>If the GPU processor is “synchronized” with the screen refresh, it will increase or decrease instantaneously, which will lead to sensory jamming or image tearing. Therefore, in order to “maintain stability”, the GPU has to be fixed in the high-frequency operation state.<br>Apple’s ltpo performs in-depth matching from processor system UI. Of course, this is also due to the good power consumption control of the processor itself. Ltpo is “icing on the cake”.<br>In other words, if Android does not carry out forced control and deep adaptation from the “core” root, even if the refresh frame rate scheduling is more accurate and the switching between different applications is more smooth, the dynamic adjustment of the screen becomes better than nothing due to the large power consumption of the processor itself.<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:pinwancool, which is authorized by lzh, 36 krypton.</p>

          <h3 id="flee"><a href="#flee" class="headerlink" title="flee"></a>flee</h3><p>During the days of isolation on the high seas, Xue LAN, a crew member of the ocean spectrum, gradually got used to being fed and cared for like a giant baby. She went to bed from morning to night and lay flat completely. She didn’t think of eating until her limbs degenerated every time she slept.<br>For a moment, Xue LAN especially sympathized with the capitalists. Her salary was paid as usual, her meals were nutritious, and her spiritual life was well taken care of by various recreational activities. “I feel guilty watching thousands of employees queue up in the staff canteen on time every day, with big mouths open…”<br>Over the past few years, Xue LAN has served the 168000 ton cruise ship of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship. Ocean spectrum is also the only cruise ship deployed by this American cruise company in China to stick to Asian waters and wait for the recovery of China’s cruise market.<br>In February, Royal Caribbean, the world’s second largest cruise company, can’t survive.<br>Royal Caribbean recently announced that in view of the extension of Hong Kong’s epidemic prevention policy, it will cancel the “no destination” voyages of the remaining high seas tours in this quarter.<br>The cruise company said that canceling the rest of the voyage this season is the most prudent decision. It believes that under the current unstable situation, it does not want to put passengers in trouble. Passengers who have booked the voyage of ocean spectrum from Hong Kong will be given a full refund, including port taxes.<br>The ocean spectrum resumed its voyage to Hong Kong on October 14 last year. At that time, more than 1000 Hong Kong guests followed the ocean spectrum from Kai Tak wharf, opening a long-awaited cruise vacation life.<br>Royal Caribbean is full of confidence in the deployment of this 2-4 night high seas theme route until this spring, saying that “the smooth departure of ocean spectrum has brought positive signals for the recovery of China’s cruise industry.<br>By the time the “ocean spectrum” left Hong Kong, the cruise ship had successfully operated 20 voyages, received nearly 40000 local tourists from Hong Kong, and there was no new confirmed case.<br>However, the plan can not keep up with the changes. The ocean spectrum went to Hong Kong in advance, which means that the Singapore sea tour season, which was originally only started by Royal Caribbean from April to June this year, has been advanced.<br>“The ship may feel that Hong Kong should not stay for a long time. Before that, it was planned to go to the Singapore market in March this year,” Xue Lan said with great regret. “The Chinese market is good. It is not easy to have Hong Kong, but it is also too passive. A positive or several close connections will stop the ‘Maritime Hotel’ carrying thousands of tourists and crew.”<br>Not only the Royal Caribbean is suspended, but the Star Dream Cruise Line under Yunding Hong Kong also needs to temporarily stop the “high seas Tour” in response to the government’s epidemic prevention policy and continue to handle refunds for customers of affected routes.<br>The travel industry previously reported that Genting Hong Kong, which belongs to Xingmeng cruise, applied for provisional liquidation due to financial difficulties earlier. On January 28, it was announced that it would submit a liquidation petition for its Xingmeng cruise. It is unknown whether it will affect the voyage arrangement.<br>Costa’s 11 cruise ships will resume flights in 2022. According to its latest information, the latest plan includes a total of more than 1800 voyages from the spring of 2022 to the winter of 2022-2023, and there is no plan for China’s home port.<br>At the beginning of 2022, the short-term “no destination route” in Hong Kong came to an abrupt end.</p>
<h3 id="Switch-to-war"><a href="#Switch-to-war" class="headerlink" title="Switch to war"></a>Switch to war</h3><p>It has been a long time for clouds on the high seas. Xue LAN is looking forward to waking up one morning and hearing the captain’s kind voice, “Dear spectrum team, we have arrived in Singapore“<br>The time when the ocean spectrum arrives at the Singapore cruise terminal is expected to be at the end of February this year. In the eyes of the crew, this city is not popular. “Who is not more interesting than Singapore in Alaska, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the Caribbean? But I also want to go to Singapore. In this situation, I can’t help being picky“<br>On the occasion of the departure of the ocean spectrum, the fifth wave of the epidemic in Hong Kong has intensified. Singapore, which has a relatively open policy towards the epidemic, has become the plan B of international cruise lines.<br>In October 2020, the Singapore Tourism Administration announced that “no destination” cruise was allowed. At that time, the trial plan was limited to the world dream of Xingmeng cruise ship and the ocean quantum of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship.<br>However, in February this year, some sharp eyed tourists found that the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship, Princess cruise ship and exquisite cruise ship have begun to sell “destination” holiday accessories, that is, the round-trip trip trip from Singapore to other countries or regions.<br>“Destination” cruise vacation is expected to resume in Singapore at the end of the year, which means that tourists aboard Singapore may go to Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.<br>The Singapore Tourism Board said that pre-sale of tickets is a common practice, but this does not mean that Singapore has approved sailing to international destinations, but in Xue Lan’s view, this is a good omen.<br>According to the official website of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship, the ocean spectrum has 13 Asian trips to and from Singapore. The first flight is scheduled to start on October 21 this year. This five night trip to Malaysia passes through bason and Penang in Malaysia and Phuket in Thailand.<br>Similarly, the Royal Caribbean’s exquisite cruise ship acme is scheduled to set sail from Singapore on January 15 next year, passing through the port of linchaban in Bangkok, Thailand, Ho Chi Minh City, Nha Trang City, hue Da Nang and Hanoi City in Vietnam.<br>The Diamond Princess of Princess cruise ship has five Asian trips to and from Singapore. The first flight is scheduled to start on December 11 this year, a seven-day trip to Southeast Asia and the Malaysian Peninsula, passing through Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia, Phuket and Langkawi in Thailand, and then returning to Singapore.<br>Seeing the company’s plan, Xue LAN began to make countdown notes on the calendar before arriving in Singapore. She listed ten life goals such as “don’t stop learning” and “keep exercising every day” on a # self-discipline, that is, freedom # list. She expected to “decorate things into her mind before arriving in Singapore, otherwise she would only grow in vain.”<br>However, does the sale of the “destination” itinerary of the above three cruise ships mean that the three cruise ships have been allowed to resume flights in Singapore and the “destination” itinerary has been opened?<br>In an interview with Xinming daily, Chen Meiyan, the cruise director of the policy planning department of the Tourism Administration of Singapore, said that it is normal for cruise companies to release the shipping schedule for reservation in advance for commercial reasons, such as planning fleet deployment. However, this does not mean that Singapore approves cruise ships to international destinations.<br>Moving to Singapore in advance is the second choice for cruise companies in the Asia Pacific sea area, and the future of cruise companies still depends on local epidemic prevention policies.</p>
<h3 id="dilemma"><a href="#dilemma" class="headerlink" title="dilemma"></a>dilemma</h3><p>Unable to bear the repeated torture of the epidemic, some crew members chose to say goodbye.<br>Different from Xue Lan’s decision to continue to go to Singapore with the ship, her three good friends chose to go home early in Hong Kong. “I don’t give up, but I won’t exaggerate it. I just go to hug and say some blessings before queuing up to leave Hong Kong“<br>Since the outbreak, the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship has suffered losses for eight consecutive quarters, the industry is depressed, and the on-off and on-off among the crew is also common.<br>Royal Caribbean International Cruise Ship recently released last year’s annual financial report, which showed that the cruise company had a net loss of $5.3 billion, higher than the net loss of $3.9 billion in the same period last year.<br>Even so, Royal Caribbean is much better off than Genting Hong Kong, another major international cruise operator.<br>Yunding Hong Kong, the parent company of Xingmeng cruise, applied for liquidation on the 18th of last month because it failed to repay its due debts, and has appointed a joint provisional liquidator to assist in restructuring the company’s business. Therefore, Xingmeng cruise, its subsidiary, suspended the sale of new tickets from the 21st of last month for an initial period of two weeks until February 4.<br>The travel industry learned that as of press time, Xingmeng cruise has not accepted new ticket reservations until further notice.<br>30 years ago, Lin Guotai, chairman and chief executive of Genting Hong Kong, actively expanded the cruise business in Hong Kong in order to disperse casino risks and diversify business. In addition to acquiring American crystal cruise, he also established Xingmeng cruise in Asia and acquired German shipyards to build ships for the company, but he did not survive the epidemic after all.<br>According to the latest research, Hongkong was the most affected destination by COVID-19 under the impact of border closures, quarantine regulations and infection threats, and the performance of tourism decreased by 75% from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, Hong Kong’s tourism industry accounted for only 3% of GDP, compared with 12% in 2019, or US $45 billion.<br>At present, the Hong Kong SAR government adopts a “dynamic clearing” policy. Due to the gradual expansion of the fifth wave of the epidemic recently, the Hong Kong Executive Council recently decided to implement a “vaccine pass” from the 24th, and you can enter shopping malls and markets after showing it.<br>When the ocean spectrum left Hong Kong waters, Xue Lan’s biggest regret was that she had not visited Causeway Bay and Repulse Bay hotels. She remembered the road leading to Repulse Bay in Zhang Ailing’s love for the city. There were dense mountains and high cliffs on the left and blue-green sea on the right.<br>“But then I thought I had visited many places in Hong Kong, so I closed my mouth wisely“<br>Xue LAN has straightened out her mind and understands that it is not easy for the epidemic to dissipate, so she doesn’t say anything about “what I want to do after the epidemic”. She puts the matter of buying a house before the age of 27 on the agenda. “When there is a deep obsession, the money will be saved“<br>All respondents in this article are pseudonyms<br>*Disclaimer: under no circumstances shall the information or opinions expressed herein constitute investment advice to anyone<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:lvjienews, which is licensed by the 36 krypton, a platinum bag.</p>

          <p>On February 7, the famous leisure snack brand Yanjin shop announced that based on the recognition of the company’s long-term value and confidence in the company’s future development, the shares held by Hunan Yanjin shop Holding Co., Ltd. will be extended for another two years.<br>It is worth noting that previously, on January 19, Yanjin shop announced the termination of the shareholding increase plan. The actual controllers, some directors and senior executives of Yanjin shop originally planned to increase their holdings by no less than 50 million yuan, but actually increased their holdings by only 12.5487 million yuan, which actually completed only 25.1% of the original shareholding increase plan.<br>Executives directly broke the deal to increase their holdings, causing extreme dissatisfaction among shareholders. As of February 14, 2022, the share price of Yanjin shop has fallen by 24% this year, and the share price has halved from the highest point in 2020.<br>From the soaring stock prices in 2019 and 2020 to the falling stock prices today; From the increase plan to “empty check” to extending the lock-in period, a series of operations of Yanjin shop reflect the process of enterprises from development and growth, to weak growth, and then to innovation and change.<br>Yanjin shop is not the only one facing the bottleneck of development. The three squirrels, a snack giant that started with internet marketing, not only went on a hot search due to the non-compliance and controversial advertising pictures, but also suffered a reduction in holdings by major shareholders.<br>Why can’t the Internet traffic of leisure snacks run? What common problems does the industry face? How will enterprises see and break down their moves?</p>
<h3 id="Drifting-dividends"><a href="#Drifting-dividends" class="headerlink" title="Drifting dividends"></a>Drifting dividends</h3><p>In the golden decade of the Internet, many industries have hitchhiked the rapid development of e-commerce and also achieved rapid expansion of scale. As a member of traditional retail, snack food can be said to be the leader in the “east wind”.<br>According to the Research Report of BOC securities, from 2013 to 2020, the compound annual growth rate of offline sales of leisure food reached 9%; The compound annual growth rate of online sales scale exceeds 45%. The increasing popularity of online shopping and the rise of e-commerce promote the rapid development of online channels of leisure food.<br>However, there are also several joys and sorrows in the snack food camp.<br>Since the beginning of Yifen, for example, the former leaders have lost their team in the wave of e-commerce. According to laiyifen’s financial report for the first half of 2021, online e-commerce channels account for only 12.9% of its total revenue.<br>In sharp contrast, three squirrels and liangpin store accounted for 70% and 52% of online revenue respectively.<br>Although Baicao flavor first opened offline stores, its sales increased significantly after its transformation to online stores in 2010, with an annual sales growth of more than 4 billion yuan and a sharp increase in revenue of more than 100 times.<br>In fact, as early as 2011, laiyifen began to layout online channels, but the result was “getting up early and catching up late”. Due to over reliance on its own applications, Laifen did not invest too much resources in the third-party platform, which naturally missed the dividend period of e-commerce.<br>With the penetration of the Internet approaching its peak in China, the curtain of the golden decade of e-commerce is slowly falling, and the future development will change from the previous high-speed growth period to a stable maturity period.<br>From the tiktok of Taobao to the present situation of Taobao, Jingdong, spelling and meet as equals, the trend of Internet centralization is inevitable. Similarly, snack brands will also adapt to the new pattern in the era of traffic decentralization.<br>In short, the good days are over, and the bad days are still ahead.<br>Tiktok Kwai, who has ploughed Taobao and Jingdong, has launched three groups of squirrels, including the rapid distribution of the fast track, the sound of live broadcasting, the group purchase, the selection of the group, the purchase of vegetables, the optimization of orange hearts, and so on.<br>According to the three first year of the squirrel’s earnings report, the number of new business operators, such as jitter, and so on, the total revenue of the new business is nearly 10%. The total revenue of the new business is tiktok, which is nearly 10%. At the same time, its promotion fee and platform service fee increased by nearly 51% year-on-year, but the drainage effect is much worse than before.<br>The company said that online platform traffic was further dispersed, and multiple traffic entrances led to a decline in the traffic of mainstream e-commerce channels and a slowdown in the growth of online sales.<br>In the future, whether online or offline, it is unrealistic to travel around the world on one leg. The new retail mode of online and offline integration will be the future development direction of the snack industry.<br>At the autumn sugar and Wine Fair in Tianjin in 2021, three squirrels announced that they would focus on offline distribution channels and plan to achieve a revenue target of 10 billion yuan in five years.<br>Zhang Liaoyuan, CEO of three squirrels, once said that the online efficiency of brands is the highest from 0 to 1, because what you see is what you get; However, the probability of people’s life radius is still offline. If you want to make the brand from 1 to 10, you still get offline.<br>Since 2020, three squirrels starting from second and third tier cities have begun to layout the third to fifth tier sinking market.</p>
<h3 id="Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war"><a href="#Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war" class="headerlink" title="Health food encirclement and suppression war"></a>Health food encirclement and suppression war</h3><p>In the era of material scarcity, snacks give people the meaning of “delicious”. The satisfaction of taste buds has become the only standard to define whether a snack brand is qualified or even excellent.<br>Who ever thought that one day, “too delicious” will eat back the brand itself?<br>“Too delicious” often means sweet and salty. In other words, there are too many seasonings and additives in food.<br>When people’s material life is rapidly enriched, consumers’ demands have also jumped from simple “delicious”. As an important part of determining health, diet began to develop in a healthier direction.<br>Delicious food is no longer the highest goal pursued by diners, and even most people are willing to give up the enjoyment between lips and teeth for health. As a result, sugar free, less salt, non fried, vegetable meat, these words stand on the capital highland with healthy food.<br>The change of consumer concept indicates the subversion of industrial logic. Members in the industry are powerless to change. Just like the original Internet trend, if they can’t ride the wind and waves, they can only be submerged in huge waves.<br>In order to get rid of consumers’ inherent impression that traditional snacks are “not very healthy”, snack brand giants have played a “health card”.<br>For example, liangpin shop has launched a high calcium bar of bovine colostrum. 90% of the raw materials are whole milk powder, and the other 10% are bovine colostrum, natural sugar substitutes, dietary fiber, etc. it is a real healthy food; In 2021, Jiajia food will clearly focus on resources and build “salt reduction” into a large single product at the strategic level; One of the new product R &amp; D ideas of Shuanghui development is to develop low-fat, low sodium and other new products around functional health food.<br>However, it is not easy for the traditional snacks of “halfway monk” to seize the healthy track?<br>First of all, the first mover advantage of healthy food has basically been occupied by major healthy food bosses.<br>The products and marketing strategies of these brands are more targeted, and have established strong reputation advantages and fan resources. It is not easy for new brands to attack the city and pull out the stronghold.<br>Secondly, how to balance the development of traditional snacks and healthy snacks is a difficult problem.<br>For example, consumers have deep-rooted impressions of traditional snacks, and it may take a long time to do a good job of ideological guidance for consumers. It is the best choice to be able to fly with both wings, but whether it will take care of one thing and lose the other, or even not fall at both ends, requires careful consideration by the enterprise.<br>The road to health is not easy.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-arm-survival-unknown"><a href="#Broken-arm-survival-unknown" class="headerlink" title="Broken arm survival unknown"></a>Broken arm survival unknown</h3><p>As an industry with low threshold, the competition of leisure snack industry is like a wolf. It’s no exaggeration to say “ten snack brands and nine nuts”.<br>In order to avoid homogeneous competition and forced to fight a price war, high-end seems to be the only way for head players.<br>According to the data of China National Business Information Center, the year-on-year growth rate of all channels in the high-end snack market in 2020 was more than 10%, far exceeding the growth rate of 6% in the overall snack market.<br>Although the development of snack categories is relatively simple, too many single items will still cause a heavy burden on the supply chain. A large number of SKUs will bring more capital risks to the brand and dilute the brand assets, resulting in problems such as increased costs and decreased gross profit margin.<br>In addition, the OEM model used by many snack brands is more likely to increase doubts about food safety and quality in front of hundreds of SKUs.<br>If we want to focus on the development of high-end lines, it means the integration of existing product lines.<br>In October 2020, three squirrels decided to cut down 300 SKUs, which is equivalent to half of the SKUs at that time. The three squirrels started the slimming plan mainly because the sales volume of these SKUs did not meet expectations and the input-output ratio was not high.<br>In the future, the three squirrels plan to transform from a full category brand to a brand of “nuts and dried fruits + selected food”.<br>Coincidentally, the high-end evolution of Yanjin shop is also in progress.<br>Different from the OEM mode of liangpin shop, three squirrels and other head leisure snack brands, Yanjin shop controls the whole chain of R &amp; D, production and sales. Founder Zhang Xuewu once told the outside world that he wanted to create a “Huawei in the snack industry” through his own unique model.<br>In 2021, Yanjin shop will also shrink its categories, including new products such as coke fish tofu, COD tofu, crab fillet and fish intestines. At the same time, it is planned to make baking, deep-sea food, spicy brine and dried fruit the forefront of the industry in the next 2-3 years.<br>Of course, the high-end road is not easy to go.<br>In recent years, although it still holds the top position of leisure snacks, the gross profit margin of the three squirrels has declined year by year, even worse than the average level of the industry. With the trend of diversified snacks gradually emerging, it may be difficult for the three squirrels to return to their peak market share.<br>In order to achieve high-end achievements, the R &amp; D expenses of liangpin store increased from 24.38 million yuan in 2019 to 33.71 million yuan in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 38%, and continued to increase year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2021.<br>From the perspective of product lines, liangpin store launched the children’s snack brand “liangpin snack Fairy” and the healthy substitute food brand “liangpin Feiyang” respectively in 2020. However, in the first half of 2021, the sales of xiaoshixian accounted for only 4% of the total revenue, and Feiyang accounted for only 2%.<br>It can be seen that leisure snack brands are still in the sowing stage of high-end upgrading war. You can only get if you can give up, but whether you can really get something after you give up remains to be verified by time.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>Although there are three leading enterprises such as squirrels and liangpin shop, the pattern of China’s leisure food industry is still very scattered. In terms of retail sales, the proportion of Cr5 in the industry in 2020 is only 10%.<br>As emerging brands such as Wang Yanfu and Shizu are favored by capital, the new forces are coming in one after another, and the white hot internal war in the industry is still intensifying.<br>Due to the low threshold and high degree of homogenization, “being imitated all the time” is an inevitable law in the snack industry. Whether it can “never be surpassed” will be the most important issue for each brand.<br>Whether it is healthy, high-end, or the decentralization of the Internet, we have to go. In the historical process of industry change, only by accelerating the pace and walking in the forefront can we have a greater chance of winning. As a foodie, we just need to taste delicious food and watch the surging of snacks in the Jianghu.<br>The picture comes from the Japanese drama “weight loss rebound”<br>Come on, what snacks do you usually like to eat?<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat’s new retail business review (ID:xinlingshou1001).

          <p>The “darkest hour” of Ningde era seems not to be over.<br>As of the closing on February 21, the share price of Ningde times has fallen to 510 yuan, and the total market value has also fallen to 1.19 trillion yuan. Such a share price crisis has been staged many times on the trading day after the opening of the market after the Spring Festival in 2022.<br>From February 7 to February 11, the share price of Ningde times fell for four days. Especially on February 11, its share price even fell below the 500 yuan mark. As of the closing of the day, it finally fell 5.43% to 489.99 yuan, down nearly 30% from the historical high of 692 yuan set on December 3, 2021. So far, the share price of Ningde era fell by 17.34% in one week, and the market value of 239.2 billion yuan was evaporated.<br>Pessimism spread rapidly among investors. “The continuous decline in the share price of Ningde era has terrified investors, and bad comments are flying all over the sky, leading many investors to believe that Ningde era still has great room for decline.” A Ningde era investor recalled to the “bullet wealth view”.<br>In fact, it is not very common for a component manufacturer in the automotive industry chain to gain widespread attention. Ningde era mainly supplies power batteries and solutions for new energy vehicles, and does not directly face end consumers. Usually, it should play the role of “behind the scenes” without too high popularity.<br>However, Ningde era has attracted much attention for two reasons: on the one hand, after more than three years of listing, the total market value of Ningde era has fully doubled by 16 times, which is dubbed “ningmao”; On the other hand, power batteries account for 40% - 50% of the whole vehicle cost of new energy vehicles. Ningde era directly affects the vehicle delivery of various new energy vehicle manufacturers and the development direction of power batteries.<br>According to the “bullet wealth view”, there are various reasons for the continuous decline of share price in Ningde era, and the deep-seated reasons point to the loosening of the view of “hegemony theory in Ningde era” held by investors.<br>A common phenomenon is that in order to ensure the smooth supply chain, new energy vehicle manufacturers increasingly do not want to rely too much on a power battery manufacturer, which may change the dominant situation in Ningde era.<br>Some people in the new energy vehicle industry once told the “bullet financial view” that the purpose of new energy vehicle manufacturers to “escape” from the Ningde era is not non cooperation, but to reduce costs in the supply chain and grasp more dominant power, so as to prevent monopoly and supply interruption in the supply chain.<br>The above investors also expressed similar views. They believe that power battery manufacturers who rush to buy orders have emerged one after another, and technical barriers have been broken. Even new energy vehicle manufacturers have begun to build their own power battery supply chain. In the long run, the trend of Ningde era may not be clear.<br>In contrast, the crisis caused by some superficial reasons is easier to solve. On February 13, Ningde times issued a statement on a series of bad remarks, saying that recently, malicious rumors such as Ningde times being sanctioned by the United States, being excluded from the gem index and collapsing with Tesla have emerged on the network platform, causing misinterpretation and misunderstanding in the market. Now it has officially reported to the public security organ and will investigate the legal responsibility of the rumor mongers according to law.<br>The continued decline of the stock price was stopped by this statement - at the close of February 14, Ningde era’s stock price returned to the 500 yuan mark to 508 yuan. However, the haze has not yet dissipated. Since the opening of the market on February 7, its share price has fallen by 11.98% and its total market value has shrunk by about 180 billion yuan.<br>The rise and fall of share price is only an abstract performance, which is reflected in specific events. On the one hand, the price of raw materials for lithium batteries such as battery grade lithium carbonate in the upstream has gone up all the way, resulting in an obvious rise in the production cost of Ningde era; On the other hand, power battery manufacturers such as LG new energy and honeycomb energy are rising, eroding the market share of Ningde era and causing local threats to it.<br>Although Ningde era has been the world’s largest power battery manufacturer for five consecutive years, it seems not easy to return to its peak.</p>
<h3 id="01-Lithium-battery-raw-materials-continue-to-be-in-short-supply"><a href="#01-Lithium-battery-raw-materials-continue-to-be-in-short-supply" class="headerlink" title="01. Lithium battery raw materials continue to be in short supply"></a>01. Lithium battery raw materials continue to be in short supply</h3><p>In recent years, the soaring price of lithium battery raw materials can be called “Crazy”.<br>According to the data of Shanghai Nonferrous Metals network, as of February 17, battery grade lithium carbonate increased by 8000 to 430000 yuan &#x2F; ton; Battery grade coarse-grained lithium hydroxide increased by 8000 yuan to 364500 yuan &#x2F; ton; Lithium hexafluorophosphate increased by 10000 yuan to 560000 yuan &#x2F; ton.<br>The price of battery grade lithium carbonate increased by 48.3% compared with 290000 yuan &#x2F; ton at the beginning of 2022 and 681% compared with 55000 yuan &#x2F; ton at the beginning of 2021.<br>Raw material prices remained high, and power battery manufacturers quickly responded. LG new energy, BYD, GuoXuan high tech, Penghui energy and Samsung SDI have announced price adjustment strategies, with price increases ranging from 5% to 20%.<br>Someone from Ningde times admitted that the short-term rise in the cost of raw materials such as battery grade lithium carbonate did have a certain impact on profits. Li Ming, a new materials analyst, revealed to bullet Caiguan that although the price of battery grade lithium carbonate has increased by more than six times, it is far from reaching the high point. “The price of battery grade lithium carbonate will continue to rise steadily in the near future, which will also lead to the rising production cost of power battery manufacturers. It is generally predicted in the industry that the price of battery grade lithium carbonate is expected to rise to 500000 yuan &#x2F; ton.”<br>However, compared with the price rise, what makes power battery manufacturers crazy is that money can’t buy raw materials.<br>“There is a big gap in the supply of raw materials,” Guo Liang, a person in the new energy vehicle industry, analyzed the “bullet finance view.” it is mainly because the outbreak of new energy vehicle sales has exacerbated the shortage of raw materials, and as a raw material supplier, it has no way to expand in a short time. “<br>Li Ming predicted that the shortage of lithium battery raw materials will continue for about 1-2 years, and the global competition for lithium resources will further intensify.<br>A fact that can not be ignored is that the control of the upstream and downstream supply chain and the stable supply of upstream raw materials have become the key to the survival and development of power battery manufacturers.<br>Investment is the most important means to control the upstream and downstream industrial chain. In order to balance the cost pressure caused by the rise in the price of raw materials, Ningde times is investing and acquiring lithium mines everywhere to strengthen the stability of its raw material supply.<br>In July 2021, Ganfeng international, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ganfeng lithium, proposed to launch a tender offer for Millennium lithium, a Canadian lithium company, with a transaction amount of no more than C $353 million (about RMB 1.820 billion), but was later intercepted by Ningde times at a price of C $378.6 million (about RMB 1.887 billion).<br>A major reason behind Ningde times and Ganfeng lithium competing to acquire Millennium lithium is that Millennium lithium has two Argentine Salt Lake projects that mainly produce battery grade lithium carbonate and lithium compounds.<br>Then, Tianhua times, a shareholder of Ningde times, invested US $240 million (about RMB 1.552 billion) in Manono lithium mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is reported that Manono lithium deposit is one of the hard rock lithium deposits with the largest reserves and the highest grade that have been found at present. The proved resource volume has reached 269 million tons and the estimated lithium resource reserve has reached 400 million tons.<br>Ningde era has also accelerated the layout of industrial chain in China. Specifically, Sichuan times new energy, a subsidiary of Ningde times, signed a joint venture agreement with Ganzi investment group, Yibin Sanjiang Huida company and Sichuan Tianfu Mining Company to increase the supply of lithium resources; In order to further accelerate the construction of lithium iron phosphate project in Shehong, Sichuan, Ningde times also signed a supplementary agreement and increased capital with Fulin Seiko and its subsidiaries.<br>In addition, Yongxing materials and its wholly-owned subsidiary Jiangxi Yongxing special steel new energy announced that it plans to establish a joint venture with Ningde times to build a project with an annual output of 20000 tons of lithium carbonate, and the output of lithium carbonate will be preferentially supplied to Ningde times.<br>It is worth mentioning that Ningde times has also jointly established 15 power battery manufacturing companies with more than 10 new energy vehicle manufacturers such as BAIC new energy and SAIC. According to incomplete statistics, more than 80% of the investment projects in Ningde era are closely related to the upstream and downstream industrial chain.<br>The advantages of binding upstream and downstream industrial chains are also very obvious. Hua’an Securities pointed out in the research report that Ningde times can get raw materials at a lower price, such as ternary cathode, which accounts for the highest proportion in the production cost of power battery, and Ningde times enjoys a discount of more than 10%.</p>
<h3 id="02-Competitors-catch-up"><a href="#02-Competitors-catch-up" class="headerlink" title="02. Competitors catch up"></a>02. Competitors catch up</h3><p>The knot of the shortage of lithium battery raw materials has not been solved, but the challengers who openly challenge the Ningde era have emerged.<br>On January 27, LG new energy, the second largest power battery manufacturer in the world and the largest power battery manufacturer in Korea, was officially listed on the Korean stock exchange. The listing of LG new energy completely ignited the enthusiasm of Korean investors. As of the close of the day, the share price of LG new energy soared 68%, with a total market value of 624 billion yuan, becoming the second highest enterprise in South Korea after Samsung Electronics.<br>In the field of lithium-ion batteries, LG new energy is a true pioneer. After 27 years of development, except in South Korea, LG new energy’s business scope almost covers the European and American markets. However, for a long time, LG new energy has been suppressed by Ningde era. Until it got a huge order from Tesla’s Shanghai factory in 2020, the momentum gradually became fierce.<br>According to the statistics of SNE research, a Korean market research institution, in 2021, the global power battery loading volume of Ningde era was 96.7gwh, with a year-on-year increase of 167.5%. The global market share increased from 24.6% in 2020 to 32.6%, while LG new energy ranked second with a global market share of 20.3%.<br>Tesla and Geely are the main customers of LG new energy in the Chinese market, but even so, LG new energy’s performance in the Chinese market is still difficult to be optimistic.<br>According to the statistics of China automotive power battery industry innovation alliance, in 2021, the top five power battery enterprises in China were Ningde times, BYD, China Innovation airlines, GuoXuan high tech and LG new energy, with market share of 52.1%, 16.2%, 5.9%, 5.2% and 4% respectively.<br>Although the total market value and market share are inferior to that of Ningde era, LG new energy has no small ambition. Earlier, Quan yingshou, CEO of LG new energy, said bluntly at the South Korean media exchange meeting, “considering that more battery orders have been received, LG new energy’s global market share is expected to exceed Ningde era and become the first in the world.”<br>Sun Guang, a practitioner in the power battery industry, disagreed with this. He told the “bullet financial view” that “if we do not improve the market share in the Chinese market, LG new energy will surpass Ningde era in the global market in the distant future.”<br>Subsequently, he added: “LG new energy’s business includes energy storage battery business, power battery business and consumer battery business, while Ningde era does not involve consumer battery business. In terms of business performance, the two sides are equal. In fact, there is still a big gap between LG new energy and Ningde era.”<br>However, LG new energy can not be underestimated. In the first three quarters of 2021, the gross profit margin of LG new energy was 24.25%, which was only 3.26% lower than that of Ningde era. It is noteworthy that the gross profit margin of the former was growing, while that of the latter showed a slight downward trend.<br>In the Chinese market, the defense of Ningde era is not solid. In addition to LG new energy, honeycomb energy also has the strength to challenge the Ningde era. On January 13, 2022, honeycomb energy conducted listing guidance and filing in Jiangsu securities regulatory bureau, and plans to log on to the science and innovation board.<br>The predecessor of honeycomb energy is the power battery division of Great Wall Motors, which began to operate independently in 2018. Although the volume of honeycomb energy is small, it has been developing by leaps and bounds. According to the statistical data of SNE research, the loading volume of honeycomb energy increased by 430% year-on-year in 2021, ranking 10th with a 1% global market share.<br>In December 2021, Yang Hongxin, chairman and CEO of honeycomb energy, revealed at the second battery day of honeycomb energy that as of December, honeycomb energy had signed more than 30 fixed-point projects, including Great Wall, Dongfeng, FAW, Geely, Hezhong new energy, Thalis and Zero run.<br>The capital pool of honeycomb energy is also quite abundant. So far, honeycomb energy has successively completed five rounds of financing, with a cumulative financing amount of tens of billions of yuan and a valuation of 46 billion yuan.<br>In addition to the above two strong rivals, BYD is also one of the strongest competitors in Ningde era. In 2021, BYD’s loading capacity was 3.39 GWH, accounting for 20.93% of the Chinese market.<br>However, at present, the blade batteries produced by BYD are almost used by its own models, which means that the loading volume of BYD alone, a new energy vehicle manufacturer, accounts for more than 20% of the Chinese market. At present, blade batteries are also favored by many new energy vehicle manufacturers, such as Tesla, velai and Volkswagen Group.<br>Sun Guang told “bullet financial view” that there are two key points in the competition among power battery manufacturers at present, one is the production capacity, and the other is the revolutionary technology. The current market pattern will not change greatly until both have not changed.<br>However, some small changes are taking place. In addition to LG new energy, beehive energy and BYD, power battery manufacturers such as China Innovation airlines, xinwanda and GuoXuan high tech have gradually entered the supply chain system of some leading new energy vehicle manufacturers, forming a siege against the Ningde era.</p>
<h3 id="03-Ningde-era-opens-up-a-new-battlefield"><a href="#03-Ningde-era-opens-up-a-new-battlefield" class="headerlink" title="03. Ningde era opens up a new battlefield"></a>03. Ningde era opens up a new battlefield</h3><p>Surprisingly, while struggling on the power battery battlefield, Ningde era has freed up its hands to open up a new battlefield.<br>On January 18, times electric service, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ningde times, launched the power exchange service brand evogo (Le hang power exchange) and the overall power exchange solution composed of three products: “power exchange block, quick exchange station and app”:<br>“Chocolate power exchange block” is a modular battery specially developed for power exchange mode. A single block can provide a endurance of about 200 kilometers, and is suitable for 80% of the models developed by pure electric platforms that have been listed in the world and will be listed in the next three years;<br>The quick change station can adapt to all models using “chocolate power change blocks”. At the same time, 48 power change blocks can be stored in the station, which can realize automatic power change, and the power change time is about 1 minute;<br>App is a supporting program specially designed for power exchange, which provides the interconnection and service of people, vehicles, stations and power blocks.<br>On February 14, at the meeting for specific objects held by Ningde times, its management explained the reasons for entering the power exchange market, “It is difficult to replace the models in the price range of 80000-120000 by electrification. The first purchase cost of new energy vehicles (excluding batteries) can be lower than that of fuel vehicles, and the replacement speed is equal to that of fuel vehicles, so as to solve the problem of cost performance.”<br>However, the significance of entering the power exchange market is more than that.<br>“The layout of power exchange business in Ningde times can help it cope with the business bottleneck period in advance and complete the commercial closed loop of ‘mining - R &amp; D and manufacturing - supply - recycling’, which is essentially to solve the anxiety about the supply of raw materials for upstream lithium batteries.” Li Ming analyzed the “bullet financial view” and said, “if the upstream raw material supply is impacted due to some uncontrollable factors, the power exchange business can play a complementary and alternative role.”<br>At the same time, the power exchange market is still a huge market with a scale of 100 billion. Orient Securities pointed out in the research report that in 2025, the number of replacement trams in China is expected to reach 5 million, about 22000 replacement power stations will be put into operation, and the scale of the operating market is expected to touch 263.1 billion yuan.<br>From the significance and market space of power exchange business, although the road of power exchange in Ningde era has bright prospects, there are still many difficulties in implementing it.<br>“The production standards and size specifications of power batteries mainly depend on power battery manufacturers and new energy vehicle manufacturers. The current market share in Ningde era is still difficult to reach the height of industry standard setters, which means that it is still unknown how many manufacturers are willing to try and adopt.” People in the industry said.<br>Another fact we have to face up to is that the power exchange business is still difficult to make a profit.<br>For example, the total revenue of Aodong new energy, a new energy vehicle power exchange service provider, in 2018-2020 was 82 million yuan, 212 million yuan and 190 million yuan respectively, while the net profit was - 186 million yuan, - 162 million yuan and - 249 million yuan respectively. Aodong new energy has not only been in the mire of loss, but also its loss continues to expand.<br>However, there is a more optimistic view that with the accession of Ningde era and the introduction of policies to further clarify the standards related to the construction of replacement power stations, the problem of industry standards is expected to be solved faster.<br>In fact, the power exchange business is not enough to fill the ambition of Ningde era.<br>In the latest record of investor relations activities released by Ningde times, an investor asked: “China Kehai sodium has cooperated with Three Gorges energy. Does the company cooperate with sodium innovative energy? How is the layout of the industrial chain?”<br>In this regard, the Secretary of Ningde times replied: “at present, the company has started the industrialization layout of sodium ion batteries, and a basic industrial chain will be formed in 2023.”<br>The price of raw materials for upstream lithium batteries is rising. In addition to laying out the power exchange business, Ningde era has also launched a plan to find alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.<br>In July 2021, Ningde times officially released the first generation of sodium ion battery. The energy density of the single cell of the sodium ion battery has reached 160wh &#x2F; kg, which is the highest level in the world. After charging for 15 minutes at room temperature, the power can reach 80%. Even in the low temperature environment of - 20 ℃, it still has a discharge retention rate of more than 90%.<br>However, compared with lithium-ion batteries with an energy density of 300wh &#x2F; kg, sodium ion batteries are slightly inferior, but one advantage of the latter that cannot be ignored is that its raw material price has a huge advantage over the former - the raw material price of sodium ion batteries is about 4000-5000 yuan &#x2F; ton.<br>In addition, the working principle of sodium ion battery is very similar to that of lithium ion battery. Its manufacturing equipment is also fully compatible with lithium ion battery, and the conversion cost is low.<br>Solid state batteries are also a major technological trend. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, although solid-state batteries are also inseparable from lithium, there is almost no consumption of lithium ions in the process of charging and discharging, which can keep the capacity of solid-state batteries stable for a long time and greatly improve the cycle life.<br>There is a view that the solid-state battery will become the ultimate form of the power battery of new energy vehicles. At the same time, it is also an important watershed and technical commanding point in the power battery industry. “The day when the solid-state battery is popularized is the time when the fuel vehicles withdraw from the historical stage”.<br>Before the emergence of revolutionary technology, it has become the consensus of power battery manufacturers to stabilize the basic plate of power battery business by expanding production capacity and constantly explore new battlefields.<br>“The leading position of Ningde era is not so easy to be shaken, but it is uncertain that a battery technology revolution will break out one day. In order to hold the position of the first brother of power battery, Ningde era can only run desperately.” The industry said.<br>*Li Ming, Guo Liang and sun Guang are pseudonyms.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:zidancaiguan.

<ol>
<li>China’s music therapy industry is getting more attention, which is related to the social background of about 54 million people suffering from depression and about 41 million people suffering from anxiety disorder.</li>
<li>The music healing industry has diversified manifestations. Not only is the offline Songbo music hot, but also platforms such as Himalaya and cool dog have entered the market. At the same time, there are also a large number of music content creators.</li>
<li>Behind the music therapy industry is the basic logic of music therapy, which has gone from theory to the public.</li>
<li>To become a music therapist, there must be professional and professional regulations, but beyond this specific concept, everyone can apply music to life for self adjustment.<br>“What do you like about this song?” Gao Tian asked the visitor.<br>“I don’t know English, so I don’t know what to sing inside, but I think it sounds good. I think this song is very kind and kind.”<br>When Gao Tian asked about the relationship between the visitor and his father, the visitor was stunned at first. He didn’t speak for a long time, and then his tears came down. The visitor said, “in my memory, I don’t remember that my father once held himself and never got fatherly love.”<br>This is an ordinary music healing scene. Gao Tian, the founder of the domestic music therapy discipline, said to the little antler music finance, “in music therapy, it is absolutely not for no reason that a person likes a song or a piece of music. It is pure and pleasant to hear. It must have something to do with his own unique life experience or the needs of the emotional world.”<br>The healing function of music is a new way of punk health preservation for a generation, which is related to the current general state of the public.<br>According to the sample survey of residents in 16 cities with a population of more than one million conducted by China Health Association in 2021, the proportion of sub-health in China has reached more than 70%, and the population in sub-health status has reached about 700 million, showing an upward trend. According to who statistics, about 54 million people in China suffer from depression and about 41 million people suffer from anxiety disorders.<br>Meanwhile, according to the survey data of China Sleep Research Association, the incidence of insomnia in Chinese adults is 38.2%, and nearly 300 million people may need sleep services such as sound therapy.<br>The 2021 white paper on Chinese scene music users released by airy consulting reveals that the principle of music therapy is actually the basic logic behind healing music.<br>So how does music therapy develop? Will music therapy guided by it be the next outlet?<h3 id="Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines"><a href="#Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines" class="headerlink" title="Music therapy based on professional disciplines"></a>Music therapy based on professional disciplines</h3>Although the first Chinese medical book, Huangdi Neijing, discusses in detail the relationship between people’s heart, liver, spleen, lung and stomach and the five tone palace Shang Jiao Yu, and puts forward the theory that “there are five internal organs to respond to the five tones”, “happy and sad, angry hurt the liver, excellent hurt the lung, think about hurting the swelling and fear hurting the arm. Therefore, the musician moves the blood circulation, spirit and right heart”, But music therapy officially became a professional discipline at the University of Casas in 1940.<br>After more than half a century of development, the scope of work of music therapists has covered many fields, such as psychology, rehabilitation, anesthesia, childbirth, hospice care, cancer rehabilitation, hospital living environment, pain control, physical and mental disease maintenance and so on.<br>In 1988, China Conservatory of music established a junior college class of music therapy, taught by Zhang Hongyi. Although due to teachers and other reasons, this major will be closed soon. But this master class opened the way for the professional development of music therapy. In 1997, under the leadership of Gao Tian, the Central Conservatory of music systematically introduced the discipline of music therapy and established the research center of music therapy. Then, the professional education of music therapy in China rose one after another.<br>However, in terms of public cognition and acceptance, music therapy is still “minority”, and this major first came into public view after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008.<br>At that time, Gao Tian led a team to the disaster area to carry out music therapy activities. In November of the same year, Gao Tian was invited to attend the annual meeting of American music therapy and delivered a speech on “music therapy crisis intervention in China’s Sichuan earthquake”, which caused a sensation in the American music therapy industry. This speech also enabled the practice of Chinese music therapy to gradually step onto the international stage.<br>In addition to discipline construction, social vocational education of music therapists is also in full bloom. Gaotian music mental health research center, China Commercial Enterprise Association, music medicine and technical equipment branch of China Medical Equipment Association and other social organizations have provided certification training courses for music therapists, and “hindmet” practical music (Chengdu hindmet Culture Communication Co., Ltd.) has also provided brand certification training for gebmusik music therapists.<br>In 2014, after many efforts, China business enterprise management association approved the establishment of the music therapist Industry Committee of China business enterprise management association. Gao Tian, Zhao Xin, Liu Mingming, Wang Bing, Liu Lichun, Zhou Ping, Wang Lujie, Zhang Xiaoying and a group of practitioners from various universities, 100 million yuan and rehabilitation centers formed a supervisor group.<br>What develops in the same way as education is practice. However, in terms of the chronological development order of music therapy in China, music physiotherapy precedes music therapy. In the late 1970s, the physiotherapy departments of some hospitals began to use music electrotherapy, including music electrotherapy and music electroacupuncture. Later, there were successively music light frequency therapy, music guidance (Music qigong) and other treatment methods.<br>In September 1984, the first music sanatorium in China was founded. From 1985 to 1986, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital and Beijing Anding Hospital cooperated with music professionals to carry out scientific research on active music therapy for senile depression and operational music therapy for chronic schizophrenia.<br>In 1991, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital established a music treatment room in the behavior treatment area, which is also the first hospital to establish a music treatment room in the national psychiatric hospital, and created a new treatment model for the rehabilitation of mental patients.<br>During the municipal government covid-19, COVID-19 and the provincial and municipal governments attached great importance to the psychological assistance of new crowns infected with pneumonia, close contacts, front-line workers and difficult people. They issued a number of psychological aid policies and measures, and asked for continuous psychological counseling, emotional support and psychological crisis intervention.<br>Beijing Huilongguan Hospital has set up a psychological rescue medical team to provide targeted and effective psychological decompression and relaxation methods for front-line medical staff in the fight against the epidemic, including music therapy. In addition, various institutions, colleges and individual music therapists in the field of music therapy have responded to the call and contributed to the cause of psychological assistance.<br>For example, Professor Wan Ying, a professor at Wuhan Conservatory of Music, led the team to start the music therapy radio, and sent two music decompression and relaxation music packages to the public through the WeChat official account. Zhang Ren, a distinguished expert from the research center of personality and social psychology of Peking University, dredged the panic psychology of the people in the form of online micro courses, and gave guidance to the medical staff in the epidemic area on music therapy technology.<br>Gao Tian, who has retired from the Central Conservatory of music, has established a “music therapy online psychological assistance hotline platform”, which solves the obstacles of face-to-face consultation technology caused by the epidemic through remote means such as ear worms, mer trauma treatment technology and music safety island, so as to carry out psychological intervention. Wen Yun and Shi Jingjie in Guangzhou jointly launched the “home music self-care action” with other music therapists, using music to provide emotional regulation and relief for residents in the sealed area.<br>Music therapy can not be regarded as self-care in the strict sense.<br>In October 2021, Gao Tian also mentioned in the academic lecture “Reflection on the development of music therapy in China and Thinking on Postmodern music psychotherapy” that the boundary between music therapy and “music entertainment” is vague, which can not reflect the uniqueness, professionalism and technicality of music therapy. Therapists must prove the medical and social value of this profession in the clinical process in order to make the public recognize music therapy as a systematic science.<br>However, music therapist Wen Yun said that music self-care is a set of public oriented methods based on “music guided imagination” in music therapy, which can spread the concept of music therapy to more people.<br>In order to make the public better understand the significance of music therapy, Zhang Ren, who has long been engaged in music therapy and clinical psychological research in the field of adolescent emotional intervention and marginal criminal behavior intervention, wrote the musical psychological drama addictive people. Different from the previous dramas promoting drug addiction and Internet addiction, the play does not blindly emphasize the serious harm of these addictions, but discusses the environmental and psychological factors of the formation of these addictions.<br>In November 2021, the third annual academic conference of the World League music therapy Specialized Committee was held in Shanghai. The topics of music therapy and music therapy, the quality standard for training professionals in music therapy, and the construction of first-rate professional were discussed in the era of music therapy and Chinese medicine, COVID-19 and post epidemic Era.<br>With the development of music therapy, the healing music industry came into being.<h3 id="Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period"><a href="#Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period" class="headerlink" title="Music healing industry in the exploratory period"></a>Music healing industry in the exploratory period</h3>According to the public data of Himalaya, in 2020, more than 83 million people listened to healing music in Himalaya, and the average consumption amount of music paying users reached 76 yuan. From 2018 to 2020, the number of healing music listeners increased by 302%.<br>By 2021, according to the white paper on Chinese scene music users in 2021 released by iResearch, the vast majority of users of healing scenes prefer soothing and decompressing music, accounting for 83.7%, and the user stickiness is high. The cumulative proportion of listening to healing scene music once a day or more is as high as 57.5%. In addition, in terms of the single listening time of users, users in the healing scene will listen for more than 1 to 2 hours at a time. In addition, many users will listen for more than 3 hours at a time.<br>In terms of willingness to pay, more users are willing to pay for soothing and decompressing music and lonely healing music. The cumulative willingness to pay for these two music forms is 82.4% and 80.7% respectively, of which users aged 26 to 30 have the highest willingness to pay. Among the types of soothing and decompressing music, users aged 31 to 35 and 41 to 45 also pay a relatively high proportion, reaching 56.1% and 50% respectively.<br>In 2021, kugou cooperated with the ear circle to launch “delta brain wave 3D immersive sleep aid music”, and worked with the medical team and psychological institutions to create a “healing zone”, including the music for the scene of pregnancy and childbirth based on the social environment with a probability of depression of up to 43%.<br>As a team focusing on situational auditory content production and technology research and development, ear circle is also the top blogger of healing music in the Himalayas. According to the ear team, the production of healing music must be based on early experiments, which is also the most important part.<br>Music healing is ultimately to act on people, with certain functionality, not just the appreciation of pure music, so it must have a basis. Based on the research of experiments and papers, discuss with musicians and sound excellence, and then use some more advanced audio production technologies, and add professional contents such as psychology and cognitive behavior therapy to ensure that the album is professional and effective, and at the same time, it also conforms to the aesthetics of Chinese people in music.<br>In addition to the ears, with the vigorous development of scene music, there are also a large number of scene music content creators in the market. Based on the market demand, kugou launched an open platform for self-service distribution of scene music and video content; After the content is released, the cool dog traffic bonus will be shared to realize diversified realization. It is understood that the open platform has gathered more than 10000 creators of various contents.<br>In addition to the online market, the exploration of music therapy online and offline has existed long ago, and the current expression methods are becoming more and more diversified.<br>The heart rhyme healing Academy established by Wang Yuan in 2006 is the leader in the sound Bowl Healing industry. At present, it has trained more than 6000 healers. The sound bowl training camp of heart rhyme therapy lasts for 12 days. The first 7 days are first-order and second-order techniques and case study; The next 5 days are marketing training. Compared with Songbo, Yinbo is more committed to cultivating excellent Yinbo healers. On December 15, 2021, the first five senses healing education and training demonstration base in China officially landed at Xinyun Beijing headquarters.<br>During the Spring Festival, due to the popularity of short-term training, Shanghai Songbo Yinbo physical and mental therapist training class is also called to start the human body’s self-healing ability through listening and physical contact, so as to help the human body restore a balanced and harmonious state of health. Fees range from 1180 yuan for the primary level to 3980 yuan for the advanced level, and the service of examining the certificate of sound therapy tutor is also provided.<br>Although there are different views on whether the effect of sound therapy can meet the expectations on the Internet, Shanghai nianqian Culture Communication Co., Ltd., established in 2018, is sought after by a group of fans for its sub-health status and career development anxiety of contemporary people.<br>The ear circle also mentioned with fawn horn music finance that some hotels will ask them to customize some albums in order to provide soothing sleep supporting music or vocals when guests sleep. Yuezi club will also customize some music to help mothers relieve anxiety and depression.<br>With the development of science and technology, AI technology has also brought new development to the music therapy industry. The ear circle mentioned that the healing music has been shaped into a three-dimensional auditory scene through some 3D engine technology and the production of virtual reality content. In the future, it may involve some means of using artificial intelligence algorithms to generate music.<br>Muru music health, founded abroad in 2020, claims to be the first music streaming media platform for people over the age of 60. It creates a personalized music experience through AI according to users’ hobbies and interests, and uses AI technology to resist the impact of brain aging. At present, the software charges its members a $67.90 (about $50) every six months, and has established an exclusive music partnership with Universal Music Australia to obtain a larger music library and cooperate with Google cloud to technically start faster and smarter work.<br>Hebei Caiwen Technology Co., Ltd. in China is a high-tech company focusing on EEG research, low-frequency sound wave pulse application and EMT EEG music therapy. Its frequency music medical team has launched frequency music headphones through the combination of low-frequency sound wave pulse technology and music therapy.<br>Referring to the current development status of the industry, the ear team said that from the experience of these two or three years, the industry is still in its infancy. The logic of the whole industry is not very clear, including the source of income and how to realize it. However, from the user feedback, there are particularly many people with sleep problems and psychological problems. Chen Fuguo, a teacher from the ear group, once said that at present, almost one-third to one-quarter of people in clinical practice have sleep problems. In addition, patients with anxiety, depression and fear also account for the majority of patients. From this perspective, music therapy still has development prospects.<br>In addition, although the overall industry is not particularly large, we have begun to pay attention to it slowly. From the amount of broadcasting in the ear, the epidemic has also prompted people to pay more attention to sleep and mental health.<br>But at the same time, some chaos also accompanied.<br>In 2020, a kind of music called “subliminal” became popular in station B. up owners claim that this kind of music can not only listen more and more beautiful, comparable to painless cosmetic surgery, but also improve financial status, eliminate viruses and private customized wishes. For a time, the number of hits of various videos has soared. At present, the number of hits of “true! High nose bridge &#x2F; nose base dry goods, sharing at the bottom of up” has exceeded 400000. However, at the top of the video, station B has marked the words “this content is for entertainment only, please don’t believe it”.<br>This kind of “song + positive guide + several good-looking photos” is a combination. Subliminal has existed on YouTube for several years, but there has been constant negative news. Blogger sapien medicine even added a sales link directly below his subliminal video. The price ranged from $22 or $3 to $136, which was called fraud by many netizens.<br>Another blogger, mind power, was accused of hiding some dark subconscious ideas in the video, which plunged the audience into nightmares and greatly affected their mental state. Some people were even sent to the emergency room. However, these symptoms gradually disappeared within a few weeks after she stopped using it. Although mind power’s account was closed, the debate continued. Rose subliminals, another blogger, publicly admitted that she had added negative hints to the video. After that, she chose to quit the subconscious community and close her YouTube account.<br>Some netizens attribute it to music therapy. So, does this belong to the category of music therapy? We consulted Gao Tian, whose master’s thesis is about the study of subliminal music. Gao Tian said that from an academic point of view, no matter looking through previous papers or through his own experiments, no significant difference was found, so this method can not be said to be useful or useless.<br>However, in the business world, no matter whether it is useful or not, as long as they see the business opportunities, some people boast that this thing is magical, “even if someone wants to cooperate with themselves, I refuse. I say you can do research on science, but push it to the market without the support of solid experimental data. I think this is a kind of deception”.<br>Gao Tian also cited an example. When he first returned to China in 1997, some people sold this at a high price. At that time, an ordinary music CD cost about seven or eight yuan, but this kind of CD sold for 2800 yuan. He falsely said that it was the high technology and subconscious of the United States. In addition, success learning was very popular at that time. Some people thought that after the subconscious input, they could succeed, Can make a fortune, so I don’t care about the 2800 yuan.<br>However, for the chaos of industry development, discipline leaders have been trying to lead the public out of misunderstanding.<br>Liu Mingming, director of the music therapy center of the Central Conservatory of music, once pointed out that music therapy is not a music prescription for symptomatic listening to music. Music is directly related to everyone’s growth background, social environment and cultural environment. Everyone has different feelings about the same music work. So we can’t say which music solves what problem like prescribing.<br>But at the same time, music has something in common. For example, medium speed and slow music with soft melody can make people relax, but it’s like asking the doctor what kind of diet is conducive to health. The doctor will give you a balanced diet, eat more vegetables and fruits and eat less greasy. It’s the most basic principle and doesn’t involve targeted treatment suggestions.<br>In addition to the short-term training of music therapists, Liu Mingming also emphasizes that music therapists can not become professional therapists. Besides the training of “music therapists + practice”, he also emphasizes that it is not necessary to participate in the short-term training of music therapists + professional therapists The issue of industry access standards for qualification certification needs to be discussed.<br>But at the same time, in addition to the professional concept of music therapist, music belongs to all mankind. Everyone has the right, ability and conditions to use music to enrich and beautify their own life, and apply music to life for self adjustment, which everyone can do.<br>Generally speaking, in terms of discipline, the goal of music therapy major in Colleges and universities is to cultivate music therapy professionals who meet the needs of society.<br>Cui Yiyun, a new generation practitioner of music therapy who graduated from the Central Conservatory of music, once said that music therapy is relatively mature in Beijing. There are professional music therapy in the Autism Center of Bo’ai hospital and the psychology department of Beijing Anding Hospital. However, in more and more cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Foshan, Wuxi, Hangzhou and Qinhuangdao, Music therapy has begun to appear.<br>In the market, there are various music therapy institutions, clinics and apps, and the industry is still sporadic and scattered. However, the exploration and attempt of the healing industry has played a positive role in the professionalization and professionalization of domestic music therapy.<br>China’s music therapy still has a long way to go, but the anxiety of the general environment makes people more and more dependent on the healing effect of music. The entry of cool dog has taken the first step. In the art examination that kicked off in the new year, another batch of fresh blood has joined the industry.<br>Will there be new entrants to the music healing market in 2022?<br>This article is from WeChat public No. ID:musicbusiness, the official account of krypton, 36 krypton.</li>
