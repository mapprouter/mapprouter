          <p>The Beijing Winter Olympics has come to a perfect end, and people are still talking about the “legend” of the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the athletes who have repeatedly achieved good results, the biggest winners this year are the sponsors and brands that invite athletes to speak for them. The reason for Su Yi’s winning the championship at the forest Olympic Games last week is that Su Yi won the three previous endorsements at the forest Olympic Games.<br>In this regard, Yuanqi forest ridiculed itself as “blessed”, and took the opportunity to open a limited edition beverage lottery, which successfully filled the marketing atmosphere.<br>What benefits did the vigorous forest of “winning the bet” get in this event?</p>
<h3 id="“Marketing-gambler”-is-vigorous-and-has-“bet”-2-7-billion-in-four-years"><a href="#“Marketing-gambler”-is-vigorous-and-has-“bet”-2-7-billion-in-four-years" class="headerlink" title="“Marketing gambler” is vigorous and has “bet” 2.7 billion in four years"></a>“Marketing gambler” is vigorous and has “bet” 2.7 billion in four years</h3><p>Yuanqi forest is “good at gambling”, which has been reflected from the first day it entered the consumer market.<br>Whether it is betting on the field of bubble water, creatively holding up the bubble water track, or a lot of “coin scattering” marketing, Yuanqi forest can always make people finally sigh “it’s OK” on the seemingly impassable road.<br>This year, Yuan Yang has gained a lot of marketing endorsements. The new spokesman, Yiyang Qianxi, signed the new year’s signing of the two films, including the water gate bridge of the long Jin lake and the “miracle kid”. It has earned the market attention. In the first new year’s drama, the “yuan C” is the “Yuan”. The sports stars who successively signed at the end of last year detonated hot spots at the Winter Olympics. A series of performances make people sigh and wonder: why is Yuanqi forest so lucky all the time?<br>No one is a born gambler, and vitality forest is no exception. The so-called good luck is just “survivor bias”.<br>As an emerging beverage consumer brand, Yuanqi forest can become popular in a short time, which can be understood as the result of its massive investment in marketing. After combing the marketing actions of Yuanqi forest in recent years, it can be found that Yuanqi forest can be seen on social grass planting platforms such as xiaohongshu and microblog, as well as variety shows and online dramas on major platforms.<br>In addition to online channels, offline channels such as elevator advertising, offline small event sponsors and convenience store freezers are also key strategic targets of Yuanqi forest. The net is wide enough to catch some shining fish.<br>But the vitality forest is not blindly casting a net. On the contrary, its purpose is very clear. From the beginning, the target customers of Yuanqi forest are white-collar workers and generation Z young people. Therefore, it will try its best in marketing.<br>For example, under the pressure of fast-paced life, young people prefer to watch variety shows online. Variety shows and online dramas have become the first goal of Yuanqi forest sponsorship. Variety shows such as “a string of life” and “a vigorous brother” are based on this logic. On the choice of spokesperson, the yuan forest also favored the new generation and national high stars, such as Chen Feiyu, Yiyang Qianxi, Gu Ailing and so on.<br>At the beginning of 2021, Yuanqi forest won the sponsorship right of station B Spring Festival Gala with 150 million yuan, realizing the leap of station B fans from 0 to 1.5 million. Although Yuanqi forest has been criticized by the outside world for its large marketing investment, it can be said that almost every penny of its investment has been shown to consumers.<br>By the end of 2020, the sales of Yuanqi forest reached 2.7 billion yuan. The sales growth rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 300%, 200% and 309% respectively, which was very amazing.<br>However, in 2022, the “gambling luck” of Yuanqi forest may not be so good.</p>
<h3 id="Can-the-beverage-giant-succeed-in-“encircling-and-suppressing”-the-vitality-forest"><a href="#Can-the-beverage-giant-succeed-in-“encircling-and-suppressing”-the-vitality-forest" class="headerlink" title="Can the beverage giant succeed in “encircling and suppressing” the vitality forest?"></a>Can the beverage giant succeed in “encircling and suppressing” the vitality forest?</h3><p>Recently, a “battle” between Coca Cola and Pepsi against vitality forest has spread in the market. It is said that there will be “no more” vitality forest in the market in 2022.<br>Whether the news is true or false, a more obvious phenomenon is that in recent years, Yuanqi forest has put pressure on many established beverage enterprises in the market.<br>The concept of “0 sugar, 0 fat, 0 calorie” health drink created by Yuanqi forest has rapidly become a trend in the context of new consumption. In its explosive growth in 2020, many established beverage enterprises such as Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, nongnongshan spring and Wahaha also tried to launch the same type of bubble water, but with little effect. In this track developed by Yuanqi forest, Yuanqi forest seems to have the absolute initiative.<br>Beverage giants are obviously unwilling to see this situation. Therefore, in 2021, many OEM factories of Yuanqi forest had to choose to shut down under pressure, which once caused Yuanqi forest to encounter a capacity crisis. Nowadays, Yuanqi forest has made greater efforts to invest in self built factories, and the lack of production capacity has played a great role in promoting it.<br>It is undeniable that since the vitality forest temporarily emerged, the beverage giants have implemented almost all-round encirclement and interception, and the latter has been struggling to survive. Obviously, in 2022, the pressure from the giants will rise to a higher level. Can the vitality forest resist it?<br>At the end of last year, Yuanqi forest disclosed some business data for the first time: as of September, the company’s R &amp; D cost had increased by 350% year-on-year. In the past 12 months, more than 30 kinds of beverage flavors have been added, and the average product R &amp; D cycle is 5.5 months.<br>It can be seen that Yuanqi forest has not stopped its R &amp; D. on the contrary, its R &amp; D investment is still increasing year by year. Besides upgrading in taste and other aspects, product lines are also extending. Now, it involves many kinds of bubbles, such as bubble water, milk tea, tea drink, functional beverage, coffee, light food Baijiu and liquor.<br>Rich SKUs make Yuanqi forest more likely to resist risks. However, it is worth noting that bubble water is still the main source of sales revenue of Yuanqi forest. If the weight of other products cannot be improved, it will be one of the hidden dangers of Yuanqi forest.<br>In addition to paying attention to the product itself, in terms of market expansion, Yuanqi forest also made a plan to go to sea early. At the end of 2021, Yuanqi forest said that in mid December, its overseas aluminum can bubble water broke into the top 10 of Amazon bubble water best seller list in the United States. At present, the products of Yuanqi forest have landed in more than 40 countries and regions, and the sea strategy has achieved initial results.<br>As a young emerging brand, Yuanqi forest does have many shortcomings, and its enterprise heritage can not compete with beverage giants. However, the emergence of vitality forest has exploded a thunder in the almost solidified bottled beverage market, just like a catfish reactivating the market.<br>The beverage industry needs fresh blood, which is the law of market development. Even if there is no “vitality forest”, other new consumer brands will launch an impact. The “encirclement, pursuit and interception” of the vitality forest by beverage giants is not only the maintenance of their own interests, but also the embodiment of their failure to timely understand the potential development trend of the market.<br>The pressure of forest giants in 2022 will not hurt their vitality, but it will not hurt them at all.<br>This article is from WeChat official account “Xiao Qian note” (ID:xiaoqianshuo), 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>Luxury is becoming more and more “luxury”.<br>In February 16th, Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury brand, once again called “LV”, has increased its price in Louis Weedon.<br>According to several media statistics, the official prices of LV classic capsules and Neverfull are 46500 yuan and 12000 yuan respectively. According to Lv’s official website, the prices of these two handbags have risen to 52000 yuan and 14400 yuan respectively, up 11.8% and 20% respectively. The price of another Mini pochette accessories rose 54% from 3500 yuan to 5400 yuan.<br>In this regard, after multi-party verification, fuel finance and economics learned that at present, the prices of LV related styles have increased in the Chinese market. For another round of price increase of luxury goods, some netizens joked, “if the price increases by 10%, will it save 110% if you don’t buy it?” Some netizens said, “people who buy LV bags won’t care about the 10% price increase.”<br>But for another price rise of LV, more consumers said they would not affect their purchase. Chaochao, a partner of a law firm in Beijing, is a loyal consumer of luxury goods, with an annual luxury consumption of 100000-300000 yuan.<br>Chaochao doesn’t care whether the price of luxury goods rises or not. “Luxury goods will adjust the price for several times every year. Now my attitude towards luxury goods tends to be rational. I will basically go shopping after signing a big order every time. I will have my own budget and taste preferences. The price rise will not directly affect whether I buy or not.”<br>The price rise of LV is confident. In 2021, despite the impact of the epidemic and the overall economic downturn, LVMH group (lvmuy. US), the parent company of LV, still achieved significant growth. According to the financial data for the whole year of 2021 released by LVMH group on January 27 this year, the annual operating revenue of LVMH group in 2021 was 64.22 billion euros, an increase of 44% over 2020 and 20% over 2019 before the outbreak of the epidemic, completely exceeding the revenue of 62.21 billion euros expected by analysts.<br>In addition, the annual operating profit margin of LVMH group reached 26.7%, an increase of 8% and 5% respectively compared with 2020 and 2019; Operating cash flow exceeded 13 billion euros, an increase of 121% and 119% respectively over 2020 and 2019. The high operating income and cash flow reflect LVMH group’s unshakable position as the “overlord” of luxury goods.<br>Data source: lvmh2021 financial data<br>In fact, more than LV, from last winter to the beginning of this spring, many luxury brands have completed the action of price increase.<br>In January this year, Chanel raised the price of some styles again on the basis of the price increase in November last year. Among them, the price of coco handle will increase by 2000 yuan, and the price of package types such as businessaffinity and Le boy will increase by 8-12%. Chanel has risen as much as 60% in the past three years.<br>The price increase of herm è s is basically fixed in January every year, and the price increase range of each model ranges from 500-4300 yuan. Lindy Mini rose from 46500 yuan to 48700 yuan, an increase of 4.7%; Verrou 21 rose 6.7% from 63550 yuan to 67850 yuan.<br>Behind the price rise is the recovery of the revenue of these luxury brands after the epidemic. In 2021, L’Oreal Group’s sales increased by 16.1% year-on-year to 32.28 billion euros, while its operating profit reached a record 6.16 billion euros, up 18.3% year-on-year, both exceeding the pre epidemic level. In the first half of 2021, Hermes group’s total sales reached 4.235 billion euros, an increase of 77% over the same period in 2020 and 33% over the same period in 2019.<br>The younger generation is becoming the main force of luxury goods. According to the 2021 luxury brand value report launched by brand France, a British brand evaluation agency, millennials contribute more than 80% of the purchasing power to luxury income. According to BCG statistics, among Chinese luxury consumers in 2021, the post-80s accounted for only 7%, while the post-90s and post-00s accounted for 50%.<br>The addition of generation Z has brought changes to the pattern of luxury consumer groups, and the pursuit of personality and consumption experience has also affected the layout of luxury marketing. In recent years, luxury brands are increasingly inclined to “please” young people in terms of product design, marketing and sales channels.<br>Will the price rise of luxury goods that try to please young people against the current economic environment have an impact on future sales? Many market participants believe that from past experience, the price rise will drain some consumers with insufficient consumption level of luxury goods, but it will not affect the rise of their revenue and net profit, but will help the brand to screen users in reverse.<br>Li Yingtao, research director of Analysys brand retail industry, told fuel finance that after the price rise, even if the sales volume of luxury goods will be affected to some extent, the probability of revenue and profit will still rise. “Some more pragmatic and rational young people may reduce their purchases after the price rise, but it will not affect loyal consumers who buy luxury goods because of class symbols.”<br>Lai Yang, executive vice president of the Beijing Institute of business economics, also said, “the appreciation of classic models is a means to preserve the value of luxury products. New designs and iterations attract young people, and old products cannot fall in price, so they continue to attract relatively conservative consumers.”</p>
<h3 id="Who-is-buying-LV"><a href="#Who-is-buying-LV" class="headerlink" title="Who is buying LV?"></a>Who is buying LV?</h3><p>Every important festival, luxury stores never lack consumers.<br>On the afternoon of Valentine’s day on February 14, there was a long line at the gates of Louis Vuitton, Dior, channel, Celine and other brands of Beijing SKP and ITC, as in previous years.<br>Fuel finance and economics observed that the queuing consumers showed a younger trend, and many of the consumers waiting at the door were young people aged about 30 or 20-25.<br>Photo &#x2F; Louis Vuitton Beijing international trade store source &#x2F; photo taken by finance and Economics<br>“Although I don’t buy it often, it’s OK to spend it occasionally.” The post-90s Lin Lin has an annual income of more than 100000 yuan. She will buy 1-2 luxury goods as planned every year. “I like to buy bags, especially the classic LV models.”<br>In Lin Lin’s view, consumption within his ability is not a waste. “If the price rises, it’s still an investment.” She smiled.<br>Unlike Lin Lin, chao chao’s consumption of luxury goods is more daily. The first time she spent tens of thousands of yuan on a bag was because of her work. “At the beginning of my work, I was responsible for some financial consulting and often had to visit some CFOs and CEOs. At that time, I was the youngest in the group and often went to see customers with canvas shoes and canvas bags.”<br>Later, the team leader said to Chao Chao, “don’t spend all your money on eating and drinking and buy a decent outfit. To make friends with customers, you should look like someone who can make friends with them.”<br>“I still remember when I wore a plaid shirt to buy Dior lady bag, my sales sister looked at me.” Chao chao smiled. “She must think I’m the kind of person who doesn’t eat and buy bags for two months. In fact, so am I. I really paid off my credit card for half a year.”<br>“Later, when I went shopping with customers, I gradually began to get in frequent contact with luxury goods. Now I can say the styles of almost every major brand. When breaking the ice with customers, there is nothing easier than talking about their watches and bags. Luxury goods, like variety shows and gossip, is a language and a signal: we pay attention to the same things and belong to the same world 。”<br>Because of the upgrading of the circle, Xingyu, who works in a large Internet factory in Hangzhou, also enters the luxury consumption brigade. Although he rarely buys luxury goods, he often buys gifts for his girlfriend, and spends 50000-100000 yuan on luxury goods every year. “I simply believe that it’s always right to buy expensive things within my ability.”<br>“Many young people in big internet factories around me have relatively high salaries and will receive six or seven digit year-end bonuses at the end of the year. Many of these people are not married and don’t have to raise children or houses, so when they get the money, they will buy luxury goods as their own reward for working in ‘996’.”<br>Shu Hua, a product manager who works in Shanghai, also enters the luxury circle because of material upgrading after work. Her annual consumption of luxury goods is 100000-200000 yuan.<br>Shuhua doesn’t pay attention to the brand when buying luxury goods. She pays more attention to the design style and shopping experience. “I seldom shop online. I basically shop offline. I like the quality and attitude of store service very much. Even if I like the style I like online, I will try it offline. This shopping experience is more enjoyable for me than shopping itself.”<br>According to the 2021 Kwai Luxe industry data report, luxury goods consumption trends in Shuangfeng. The 18-23 year old Z generation and the 41-49 year old crowd are also the main force of luxury consumption. The 2021 luxury industry report released by Deloitte also pointed out that the luxury consumption of generation Z showed an obvious growth trend, and said that the love of generation Z for luxury goods is likely to be affected by the consumption behavior of their parents.<br>Source &#x2F; massive engine<br>Kiki, born in 1997, is such a girl. Kiki, who lives in the northeast, went shopping with her mother since childhood, “At that time, there was no concept of famous brand, and there was no concept of whether it was expensive or not. I only knew whether it was good or not. Because my mother liked LV, I naturally had feelings for the brand. However, after college, I began to prefer Celine. Some styles of LV were not personalized enough. Luxury goods were just consumables for me. Therefore, I was more interested in the value or preservation of the brand or product Value your preferences, sense of design and sense of fashion. “<br>Kiki represents the psychology of generation Z luxury consumers. According to the report “new faces of Chinese luxury” released by orvey data, the number of generation Z who buy luxury goods will buy the popular models of the season rather than the classic ones with value preservation is twice that of consumers over the age of 35.<br>According to orvey data, 40% of generation Z are willing to invest more in luxury consumption, of which more than 18% accept to invest one-fifth of their income in luxury consumption. These young people weaken the symbolism of luxury goods and emphasize the pursuit of a sense of design, personalization and experience. Catering to the mental trend of these consumers has become a new challenge for luxury goods.</p>
<h3 id="Luxury-goods-“please”-young-people"><a href="#Luxury-goods-“please”-young-people" class="headerlink" title="Luxury goods “please” young people"></a>Luxury goods “please” young people</h3><p>With the younger and younger consumer groups, these luxury brands need to “please” young people more and more. Since the 1990s, when luxury goods entered China, they have continuously upgraded their design and marketing, and “please” young people with all kinds of tricks.<br>Before 2015, due to the lack of advantages in domestic purchasing power, the full popularity of social media and the traffic is not in the golden age, the brand marketing communication in this period generally followed the traditional straight-line thinking of the luxury industry from top to bottom. At that time, the purchasing power of major luxury goods in China still valued the significance of their class symbols. The design of luxury goods was mainly formal clothes, with little addition of Chinese elements.<br>After 2015, due to the exponential growth of the purchasing power of luxury goods in the Chinese market and the popularity of the Internet and we media, luxury goods began to be younger and upgraded.<br>In 2018, Dior opened its tiktok account and became the first luxury item to eat crab. Subsequently, in 2019 and 2020, Dior successively settled in xiaohongshu, station B and tmall.<br>While in-depth traffic marketing, Dior began to choose China as the important and even the first show of its big show. On April 12, 2021, the release show of Dior 2021 autumn ready to wear series was held in Shanghai. The show was broadcast live on multiple platforms that night, and the cumulative number of viewers exceeded 120 million.<br>Dior’s successful communication with the Chinese market makes it the most resistant luxury brand under the epidemic. Erwan rambourg, an analyst at HSBC, estimates that Dior’s sales reached 6.28 billion euros in 2021, contributing 10% of LVMH’s total revenue and 13% of the group’s profit. According to the latest financial data of LVMH, the sales volume of Dior’s fashion leather Department reached 30.996 billion euros in 2021, an increase of 47% over the same period in 2020 and a strong increase of 42% compared with 2019.<br>Dior’s success once again confirms the power of China’s luxury consumption. Tiktok, the LVMH group’s LV, followed by the jitter platform, and its official account fans exceeded 1 million 440 thousand by February 21, 2022.<br>On November 17, 2021, LV selected Shanghai as the spring and summer women’s clothing show in 2022. This is the second time that LV has held a physical show in China after the epidemic, and it is the first time that the brand has brought the show of Nicolas ghesqui è re, director of women’s clothing art, to Chinese consumers.<br>Compared with the Dior show, LV added Chinese elements to the design and further deepened targeted marketing. The show showed 19 sets of brand-new design shapes specially designed for the Chinese market. Loop handbag, one of the exclusive handbags, showed the “scarf printing” composed of Lv’s iconic gold chain and leather belt.<br>Boldly breaking through the formal style, the design with the theme of fantasy, space travel and casual formal dress has attracted more young people’s attention. The total viewing volume of big show videos exceeds 160 million, and the reading volume of #lv spring and summer 22 women’s wear show # topics on microblog is 1.54 billion. Fashion media person Wu Ling commented on the design of women’s clothes at the show as “exquisite relaxation” in the article “the appearance of the ideal Wardrobe”.<br>Chinese elements and the limited design of leisure trend have also become a “big move” for luxury goods to seize the minds of young people.<br>In 2022, Valentino and Balenciaga successively launched the year of the tiger limited edition. Valentino 1967 series launched tops and handbags with pink and black stripes as the visual focus; Paris World launched an oversize coat that imitates tiger skin stripes. After the launch of the two exclusive models, they quickly attracted attention. Beijing SKP has little red book fashion bloggers to try them on almost every day, and the avant-garde design has attracted a large number of student party messages and inquiries.<br>After the design iteration, luxury goods have played fancy marketing.<br>In the past, luxury goods too described ancient and long-standing brand stories, such as the division and civil war of Gucci family, chanel and her lover, etc. these mysterious and gossip stories captured the first batch of luxury goods buyers’ longing for foreign life, but failed to move the heart of generation Z. Young people prefer bold, unconventional and fresh marketing to stereotypes that cannot be investigated.<br>In September 2021, Prada, who released a large advertising blockbuster in autumn and winter, settled in Shanghai Wuzhong market, which really let the market feel the breath of Prada’s life at a close distance. The appearance of the vegetable market is full of Prada’s main visual elements in the season. The dishes are wrapped in Prada’s environmental protection paper bags. The vegetable market is called “half a gathering place of Shanghai KOL” by xiaohongshu users.<br>Figure &#x2F; source of Prada Shanghai Wuzhong market &#x2F; screenshot of Xiaohong shuran finance and Economics<br>Gucci is actively trying in the field of social marketing. In 2020, Gucci will use circle of friends advertising to become the first luxury goods to send red envelopes in China. In the Spring Festival of 2022, the red envelope on the cover limited by Gucci and Doraemon was “opened” more than 30 million times in two weeks. It went online for two hours and rushed to the hot search with 210 million readings, successfully breaking the circle. After the Spring Festival, the average daily number of “dismantling” red envelopes remained at 36% of the activity period, bringing a long-term exposure effect to the brand.<br>LV arranges different online applets according to different user segments, including LV squared series experience stores in early spring of 2022 classified by season, men’s limited time stores in spring and summer, furniture hard box stores and new product experience stores classified by product category, and sneakers store for post-90s trendy men.<br>“For Louis Vuitton, wechat mall is not regarded as a single sales channel, but a part of the overall brand experience and retail ecosystem built by LV in China,” said the senior vice president of digital Asia of LVMH in the digital trend report of China’s luxury market<br>“China’s luxury market is very diversified, and the consumption preferences of different customers vary greatly. Therefore, we create all kinds of small programs to connect with different customer groups with their unique styles and contents. At the same time, these small programs have different ways of entry, but they always’ appear when you need it ‘, so as to provide customers with convenient and ultimate shopping experience to the greatest extent.”<br>The upgrading of design and marketing is nothing more than making an article on the “sense of experience”. Luxury goods firmly grasp the contempt of generation Z for “class” and “face”, pay attention to the satisfaction and freshness of consumption, and fully “take care” of generation Z consumers, which is also the foundation for the rise of luxury prices.</p>
<h3 id="Will-luxury-goods-“lose-powder”-after-the-price-rise"><a href="#Will-luxury-goods-“lose-powder”-after-the-price-rise" class="headerlink" title="Will luxury goods “lose powder” after the price rise?"></a>Will luxury goods “lose powder” after the price rise?</h3><p>In the economic environment is still in the doldrums, will the price rise of luxury goods that try to please young people once again affect the loyalty of consumers? The answer is No.<br>As for the price rise of luxury goods, Kiki said that this is also an old saying. “The reason for each price adjustment is that raw materials are expensive, imports and exports are expensive, etc. I am not very sensitive to prices. I mainly look at the style, whether it is suitable and whether I like it or not.”<br>Shuhua also said that the price increase will not affect their buying habits. “I have no car or house in Shanghai. I belong to the type of people who enjoy themselves in a hurry. If I have money, I don’t spend much. Therefore, I will start when I encounter what I like after the price increase. However, I certainly have the upper limit of price expectation and won’t let myself go to the point of not eating, drinking, buying bags and jewelry.”<br>Li Yingtao said that this is a normal market behavior, “The inflation caused by currency excess, the imbalance of the supply chain caused by the epidemic, and the supply chain shock caused by anti globalization are all the reasons for the rise in the price of luxury goods. The regular rise in the price of luxury goods is just like the rise in the price of our daily consumer goods, but because of the brand effect, their price rise will be greater and attract more attention.”<br>In fact, this is not the first time that LV has raised its price. According to public reports and statistics, LV has adjusted its price four times in October 2019, January 2020, September 2020 and January 2021. Netizens joked, “a bag has increased by 95% a year, which is higher than my fund.”<br>In the past two years, luxury goods have increased year by year, or even n has become the unspoken rule of the brand.<br>From the previous financial data released by LVMH, the price rise did not make it “lose powder”.<br>In 2020, due to the impact of the epidemic, the total revenue of LVMH decreased by 22% from 53.67 billion euros in 2019 to 44.65 billion euros, while the total revenue in 2021 was 64.22 billion euros, a year-on-year increase of 44%. It can be seen that the two price increases in 2020 have not affected consumers’ preference for luxury goods.<br>The increased unit price and revenue have greatly increased the group’s recurring operating profit and net profit. In 2021, the group’s recurring operating profit was 17.151 billion euros and its net profit was 12.698 billion euros; Year on year growth of 106.51% and 156.27% respectively in 2020.<br>Data source &#x2F; lvmh2021 financial data<br>In the Asian region dominated by China, the preference for leather bags and fashion bracelets is particularly obvious. In the financial report, LVMH’s income from fashion and leather products in 2021 increased by 47% year-on-year compared with that in 2020, reaching 8.964 billion euros. Among them, Asia accounted for 41% of the total revenue of fashion and leather products, with a year-on-year increase of 53.17%.<br>Data source &#x2F; lvmh2021 financial data<br>Lv’s new LV pont 9 handbag and its new Dior fashion product rose Dior were the sales leaders last year. The clerk of LV Beijing world trade store said that Lv’s classic Bracelet Idylle blossom series is also very popular among post-95 consumers.<br>These popular styles are simple, fashionable, versatile and casual, which are more in line with the aesthetics of generation Z. they are often “brushed” by young bloggers of xiaohongshu. The exposure of grass planting platforms and the increase in sales have proved that consumers have the purchasing power not affected by price fluctuations.<br>Indeed, price increases will also block out some people who tend to consume rationally.<br>For this part of the people who are affected by the price rise and reduce their purchases, Lai Yang said that the part of consumers who pay attention to cost performance after the price rise is not the main crowd of luxury goods. Regardless of price, generation Z, who pursues individuality and is willing to pay for fashion, is the main target of luxury strategy.<br>“Therefore, in the future, luxury goods need to accelerate the design of iterative exclusive models, increase social operations, grasp the young people’s psychology of sharing and impulsive consumption, and upgrade the offline shopping environment, so as to firmly grasp the young people who are willing to pay for fashion.”<br>reference:<br>“The price of luxury goods has risen again, this time Lv”, source: Sina Finance and economics;<br>Fashion intelligence LV joined the ranks of price rise, L’Oreal made a record profit last year, source: China first finance and economics;<br>Analysis of financial report ｜ Hermes’s profit margin in the first half of the year is the highest in ten years, and it is difficult to “catch up” in the second half of the year.

          <p>At the beginning of 2022, the new energy vehicle making force continues to make rapid progress, and the traditional automobile brands are still exploring in the transformation. However, market sales seem to prove that the market seems to have little time left for traditional brand exploration.<br>On February 14, Great Wall Motors (2333. HK) released the sales announcement in January. The data showed that the sales volume in January 2022 totaled 111800 vehicles, a year-on-year decrease of 19.59%. The next day, Great Wall Motor’s share price jumped 4.75% to HK $18.44, the lowest since May 2021.<br>Generally speaking, compared with the decline in sales at the end of the year, the decline in sales of automobile brands at the beginning of the year deserves more attention from the market, because some 4S stores often calculate the orders before the end of last year after the year, so as not to make the sales at the beginning of the year too ugly. On the other hand, January was the peak season of automobile sales in previous years. After all, many consumers took advantage of the new year to go home, I will rush to buy the car years ago, and the sales volume of all brands will not be poor.<br>From this perspective, the decline in sales of Great Wall Motors in January may be more worthy of market attention.</p>
<h3 id="The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line"><a href="#The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line" class="headerlink" title="The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line"></a>The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line</h3><p>Judging from the trend of the capital market, the Great Wall stock price has entered a new round of decline. Since October last year, the Great Wall stock price has almost halved after falling from its high point. As of February 18, the share price of Great Wall Motors fell to 38. 25 yuan.<br>On the one hand, the capital market has entered the downward channel. On the other hand, from the storm of tank 300 delivery to the “core change door” of Euler good cat, and then to the recent shutdown of black cat and white cat, it seems that the transformation of the Great Wall is still a long way off.<br>2021 will be a year of ups and downs for the Great Wall. On the one hand, its 300 tanks, which mainly focus on small cross-country vehicles, have sold 84588 units, accounting for almost half of the domestic cross-country vehicles. On the other hand, as the production capacity of new vehicles is seriously lower than the market expectation, of course, the lack of core is one of the important factors. As time goes by, the market enthusiasm dissipates, and the growth expectation in the future is declining.<br>Reflected in the capital market, under the haze of the epidemic, the share price of Great Wall Motors rose nearly tenfold from the peak in 2020 to 2021. By the end of 2021, the popularity of individual models was no longer, the capital market returned to rationality, and the high point of Great Wall stock price fell sharply.<br>There are generally two reasons for the decline of the high point of auto enterprises. One is the sharp decline in sales volume, and investors are bearish on the future growth of brand models. On the other hand, the overall market expectation decreases. For example, after the rise of Tesla, the market will inevitably make new adjustments to the valuation of traditional auto brands, because in the stock growth, the growth of new energy brands may correspond to the decline of traditional brands.<br>Overall, the withdrawal of the market value of the Great Wall shows that the expectations of the capital market are declining, and the shutdown of some of its new energy models may once again be bad for the growth momentum of the Great Wall in the new energy market.<br>On February 15, two new black cat and white cat models of Great Wall Motor’s brand Euler stopped accepting orders. Officials said that the two models were forced to stop production because of the shortage of chips, the supply of spare parts and the decline of new energy subsidies. Tianyancha app information shows that Euler brand was founded in 2001 and has experienced five rounds of financing.<br>In June last year, Great Wall Motors released its 2025 strategic target, which mentioned that the target sales volume was 4 million units, of which 80% were new energy vehicles, and the expected revenue was 600 billion.<br>From the sales ranking of new energy cars in January this year, the Great Wall’s brand Euler has only one Euler good cat in the top 10. In January, the sales volume of black cats reached 8612, while the sales volume of Euler black cats was only 3891. The sales volume of BYD Han, the third highest in the sales volume list, reached 12781, and the sales volume of Wuling macro mini, the first, was 26682.<br>With the rapid development of new forces, transformation is the top priority of traditional automobile brands. However, from the perspective of sales volume, the electric transformation of great wall seems to be out of step with the pace of the industry. The reason may be that the multi brand strategy of Great Wall Motors is not going smoothly under the burden of fuel vehicle brands.</p>
<h3 id="Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy"><a href="#Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy"></a>Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy</h3><p>On the road of transformation, the Great Wall chose a “Shu Road”.<br>On the one hand, the wings of its new energy brand are not yet full, and the cash flow business that the group can rely on is still the fuel vehicle business. On the other hand, the market space of Harvard H6, the main sales force in the fuel vehicle market, is being squeezed by Geely, Chang’an and other competitors.<br>For example, in the traditional advantage SUV market of great wall, the models such as Xingyue l released by Geely in the past two years and cs75 under Chang’an have stronger product power. On the one hand, Haval’s response is to fight a price war with its competitors through the subdivision of H6 models. On the other hand, the VV series products under Wei brand have not opened a big gap in sales.<br>On the whole, facing the pressure of competitors step by step, Great Wall’s strategy seems to be to maintain the growth of fuel vehicle market through multi brand diversified expansion strategy.<br>An important reason supporting this decision is that the market demand has changed. On the one hand, with the automobile consumption track becoming a big red ocean track, but some segments of the track are still blue ocean market, such as the hard core cross-country track with a price range of 150000-250000 yuan. In fact, the success of the tank 300 is the success of the excavation subdivision.<br>In short, the change of consumers’ preferences promotes the further differentiation of market demand, resulting in the birth of a new blue ocean.<br>The popularity of tank 300 shows that there is no problem in the overall direction from large-scale accumulation to deep cultivation in market segments, which may also be the reason for the soaring share price of Great Wall in 2021. The retreat of the Great Wall stock price at the end of the year may be due to the potential problems found in the market.<br>There is no problem with the direction of market segmentation. The problem is that the brand front is too long.<br>From the perspective of brand positioning, Euler is more likely to be positioned as a fashion brand for young women, tanks are positioned as hardline cross-country, and Great Wall guns are positioned in the pickup truck market, focusing on villages and fourth and fifth tier cities.<br>If the brand front is too long, it will easily lead to the dispersion of resources. No matter in which market segment, once the market segment is verified, there will be competitors. Even if the segment track where Euler and tank are located is still the blue ocean market in the short term, the competitors will follow up quickly.<br>For example, in the field of hardline off-road, Chery’s brand jietu announced to officially enter this segment.<br>The launch of tank 300 is an important symbol of Great Wall Motor’s deep cultivation of market segments and high-end transformation. The popularity of the market highlights the problem of capacity climbing of tank 300. On the one hand, the production capacity is seriously disconnected from the short-term demand of the market and does not use the accumulation of brand reputation. On the other hand, when there are more and more players in the market segment, more and more resources will be required to be invested under competitive pressure. On the contrary, it will fall into long-term consumption, which will affect the profits of the group.<br>For example, Harvard H6 sales declined in 2017, followed by the launch of the red and blue standard Haval H6 coupe and the new Haval H6, and the number of models increased to 55. Under the market competition, 2018q3 Haval officially announced that Haval’s best-selling models were fully preferential, resulting in a sharp decline in profits in the quarter.<br>In the long run, a negative result of the multi brand front is that the resources of the group’s electric transformation may be further dispersed.<br>In fact, looking back at the development process of auto giants such as Ford and Volkswagen, it is not difficult to find that they have also experienced rapid brand expansion. Later, facts have proved that too many fronts are not conducive to the growth of the overall business. In the follow-up development, the waste of resources is increasing due to too many brands, and consumers’ brand cognition is further dispersed.<br>As a result, Volkswagen and Ford began to shrink their product lines again to further improve product efficiency. Later, Volkswagen launched the MQB platform and moved towards the route of intensive growth.<br>In fact, the Great Wall brand models have an obvious feature, that is, the popularity of new cars is very high, but there are not many hard power products that can really stand the test of time.<br>For great wall, H6 model is one of the few models that have been tested for a long time, which gives great wall the opportunity to launch brand-new Wei brand, tank, Euler and other follow-up brands and deeply cultivate the market segments. How much trial and error space the traditional fuel vehicle market can bring to the transformation of new energy may be a question that needs to be considered.</p>
<h3 id="Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments"><a href="#Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments" class="headerlink" title="Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments"></a>Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments</h3><p>A practical problem is that with the continuous growth of the new energy vehicle market, the transformation time of traditional brands is shortening.<br>Under the double score policy, the performance of new energy vehicles will directly affect the growth of the overall business of the brand group. On the other hand, with the introduction of fuel vehicle sales schedules all over the world, traditional brands urgently need new energy to open up new large-scale growth.<br>The transformation road of great wall new energy seems to be still long.<br>In addition to the expected future growth, the quality problem of Euler brand models is also the threshold that Great Wall Motors must cross in its transformation.<br>According to the statistics of vehicle quality network, from December to February 19, 2021, the quality complaints about Euler’s good cat ranked first. In addition to the publicity problems, there are also some problems such as body accessories and electrical appliances. In addition, there are a series of problems such as video and audio faults, on-board interconnection faults and so on.<br>From the distribution of product problems, the complaints about Euler on the vehicle quality online also seem to reflect the maladjustment of Great Wall Motors on the road of transforming new energy. If this does not adapt to the long-term, it may affect the long-term growth of Euler brand.<br>User reputation is the first vitality. Product quality problems can have a far-reaching impact on the accumulation of brand reputation and long-term sales growth.<br>For example, the reputation of German brands has declined in the past two years, while the reputation and sales volume of Japanese brands are increasing. To a certain extent, this is the long-term impact caused by product quality differences. As far as the Great Wall is concerned, this point deserves vigilance.<br>The most important thing in the transformation of traditional automobile brands to new energy is scale.<br>Why can Tesla succeed? Not because of how amazing Tesla Model s is. Instead, model 3 completed the rapid scale of the new energy market in a short time through price reduction.<br>Some domestic manufacturers are aware of this. For example, SAIC launched Wuling Hongguang Mini. On the one hand, the substantial growth of sales volume has brought a lot of points to fuel vehicles. On the other hand, in this process, they unknowingly completed the brand transformation, laying the groundwork for Wuling brand to launch electric products in the future.<br>A reality that great wall has to face is that the Euler brand with gender preference may be difficult to lay the foundation for long-term market growth through effective scale.<br>From the perspective of market strategy, for automobile brands, the women’s market is a blue ocean market after hardline off-road, but one thing that can not be ignored is that the main force of the current automobile consumption market is, on the one hand, the family as the unit, on the other hand, the market consumer group is still the male group.<br>Great Wall’s biggest weakness in positioning the Euler brand may be that the overly obvious gender label naturally rejects the mainstream car owners.<br>In other words, even if the good cat and other models under the Euler brand can sell more than 10000 vehicles per model, its brand influence and reputation may be far less capable of driving sales than the new energy brands of other fuel vehicle manufacturers. From the perspective of long-term growth, the brand of Euler will be the main place to enter the market.</p>
<h3 id="Write-at-the-end"><a href="#Write-at-the-end" class="headerlink" title="Write at the end:"></a>Write at the end:</h3><p>The transformation of traditional automobile manufacturers into new energy requires not only changing products, but also changing thinking.<br>The strategy of multi brand expansion of Great Wall Motor’s segment market can indeed meet the consumers of the segment market and enjoy the blue ocean dividend of the segment market in the early stage. However, in order to tap these segments for a long time, it needs a higher product power moat, and the sustainability of the product life cycle may be limited, resulting in a waste of resources.<br>In the long run, this is not conducive to the transformation and development of the whole Great Wall group. Next, how to capture the eyes of capital and realize the scale of new energy business more efficiently may still be a problem that needs in-depth reflection for the Great Wall.<br>This article is from WeChat public No. ID:IPOxscj, the author of the 36 official account of the company.</p>

          <p>According to techcrunch, Congo based start-up Jambo recently announced that it had raised $7.5 million in seed funds, including coinbase ventures, 3aC, Alameda research, tiger global, Delphi ventures, alliancedao, defiance capital, yield guild games, polygon studios, and some angel investors from Web3 ecosystem, For example, Sandeep nailwal, co-founder and CEO of polygon, Santiago r Santos, former parafi partner, do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of terrain labs and partners of Delphi digital piers kicks participated in this round of investment.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>The start-up company “Jambo” was founded in November 2021. They are committed to building “Web3 super application” in Africa and obtain income opportunities through the logic of “learning, playing and making money”. Some experts said that Southeast Asia has become one of the best markets of Web3, and Africa is about to be overturned by Web3. Startups such as axie infinity and yield guild games are located in Southeast Asia and have raised millions of dollars in venture capital. The combination of rapid population growth, stable smartphone penetration, increased adoption of cryptocurrency, low per capita GDP and high unemployment makes Africa the next mature place of Web3.<br>James Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Jambo, said that Jambo hopes to add millions of users to Web3 in Africa through its application. Similar to axie infinity and other guilds, users can only earn income when playing games in revenue sharing mode, while “Jambo” adopts a two-way approach, allowing its users to earn income when participating in web2 and Web3 activities.<br>For example, users can save data expenses when using “Jambo”. James Zhang explained that “Jambo” can get a discount of nearly 70% in cooperation with telecom suppliers and sell it directly to users at a discount of 50% of the original cost. “This is one of our main user acquisition strategies. We hope to double the call time and data of each African.”<br>Second, “Jambo” is working with social media companies, so users can earn tokens when viewing their content on their apps, which can be converted into cash income. “By working with these social media companies, we tokenize part of their advertising budget and provide it directly to end users,” James Zhang said.<br>In addition, James Zhang said that at present, there are no Web3 games from Africa that make money through games because of the lack of certain infrastructure. Jambo wants to build such infrastructure. Nevertheless, “Jambo” does not intend to take a share of users’ income. Instead, Jambo’s revenue will come from the web2 model - charging advertising fees and commissions by selling call time and data.<br>As the “gateway to Web3 in Africa”, James Zhang said that Jambo will test more than 10 games in the coming months to introduce its operation to users. “Education is at the heart of our work, because I don’t think there is a shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can consider making a profit at the end of the day or start acquiring users again, which is why we launch education courses on Web3,” he said.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>“Every component in our super app is actually designed to help ordinary people make money, such as watching videos to make money and save data expenses. So ideally, within three to six months after our app goes online, ordinary people can make $50 a month by playing axie infinity and another $20 a month by watching videos.”<br>“Jambo” is expected to release its beta version in the second quarter and officially launch in the third quarter. “What wechat has done in China,” Jambo “will also do in Africa. We are also pleased to support this a + team to become a Web3 super application on the African continent,” Web3 investor and former parafi partner Santiago r Santos said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Wen Silai yuan<br>Editor Su Jianxun<br>On February 21, Huawei released the latest wireless product solutions, mainly for operators, providing TDD third-generation massive MIMO products and FDD ultra wideband multi antenna series.<br>The so-called TDD (time division duplex) and FDD (frequency division duplex) refer to different information transmission modes. Huawei’s products released this time cover two modes, which will cooperate and eventually move towards “multiple frequencies and one network”.<br>Compared with the past, the third generation products can be configured with lower transmission power, reduce energy consumption by about 30%, and have a wider coverage. On the other hand, compared with the second generation products, the antenna array is nearly twice as many and the signal is stronger. The commercial FDD massive MIMO released by Huawei this time can increase the 4G network capacity by three times. If it is upgraded to 5g, the capacity can be increased by five times.<br>They also launched corresponding solutions for residential areas, urban hotspots and other scenes, which can be deployed by operators in a minimalist manner. This is also the only distributed m-mimo (large-scale multiple input and output technology) in the industry. Compared with 4t4r (four transmitting antennas and four receiving antennas), this scheme has a four times increase in network capacity, mainly for the demand of 5g in indoor scenes such as railway stations and shopping malls.<br>Operators have always wanted to have more products with large bandwidth and multiple antennas. Huawei has always been the industry leader in this technology. For a long time, mobile phones accounted for the majority of Huawei’s revenue. Now, operators and enterprise businesses will become the main body again.<br>According to Huawei’s financial report for the first half of 2021, in the first half of last year, Huawei’s consumer business fell 47% year-on-year, operator business fell 14.2% year-on-year, and enterprise business including Huawei cloud increased 18.2% year-on-year. It can be expected that compared with the steep decline of consumer business, operator business and enterprise business will become the key in the future.<br>Of course, the business of Huawei operators is also under pressure. Huawei 5g equipment has been abandoned in Europe. However, compared with mobile phone business, the decline of operator business will be relatively slow.<br>However, Huawei obviously continues to invest in 5g technology research and development. The products released this time also represent that Huawei will not give up 5g dividends. The next generation communication network is far from universal. At this time window, Huawei also hopes to build a deeper moat.</p>

          <p>This winter Olympics is not only a feast of sports, but also a feast of science and technology. The application of 5g, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other technologies fully demonstrates the power of science and technology and the concept of innovation. It is reported that a total of 212 technologies have been applied in the Beijing Winter Olympics, involving more than 60 subdivided application scenarios, of which 4 technologies are launched for the first time in the world and 33 technologies are used for the first time in the Winter Olympics.<br>Behind the opening and closing ceremonies and Winter Olympic competition facilities that amaze the world, it is inseparable from the technical support of many domestic science and technology enterprises. According to statistics, more than 70 enterprises have contributed to the Winter Olympics, including the opening ceremony, competition clothes, playground and so on.<br>In this article, the Hong Kong stock research society makes an inventory of the technical leaders behind the “black technology” of the Winter Olympics.</p>
<h3 id="Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast"><a href="#Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast" class="headerlink" title="Hard core technology helps visual feast"></a>Hard core technology helps visual feast</h3><p>First of all, there is a highlight of this year’s Winter Olympics, that is the “main torch”.<br>The seemingly simple torch has many scientific and technological elements behind it. The outer streamer, inner streamer and combustion system are jointly tackled by Aerospace Science and technology group, Harbin Institute of technology and Hart, printed by 3D technology, and assembled after post polishing.<br>The main torch uses hydrogen with green environmental protection and good flammability as fuel, realizing zero carbon emission of the torch in the history of the Winter Olympic Games. It has been burning over the bird’s nest from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony. Meijin energy, power source and Haohua technology are the main suppliers of hydrogen energy for the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the main torch, the special effects at the opening and closing ceremonies are also impressive.<br>At the closing ceremony, along with the melody of “me and you”, the five dreamy rings of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games rose slowly and intersected with the snowflake torch platform to connect the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in an innovative way to commemorate the “double Olympic moment”.<br>In the classic song “farewell”, 80 dancers walked slowly into the entrance. With the steps of the dancers, a picture of weeping willows gradually appeared. In the center of the site, countless green beams pass through the snowflake torch platform and reach the sky to form a big tree composed of beams.<br>According to Wang zhiou, it is an innovative project to capture the real-time effect of the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony of the ice and snow by using the 3D technology of AR zhiou, which can enhance the realistic effect of the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony.<br>In the fancy skills of the opening and closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, the LED large screen is indispensable. With a total area of 11626 square meters, the Winter Olympics led stage is currently the largest LED stage in the world.<br>The ground screen is jointly manufactured by listed companies lyade, BOE and Zhouming technology. Lyade provides more than 7000 square meters (the central part of the ground screen), and BOE and Zhouming technology provide about 4500 square meters (the semi arc parts on both sides of the ground screen). Among them, liad also undertook many LED display projects such as ice waterfall, ice cube, grandstand and playback system at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games.<br>In addition, in order to show the shocking light and shadow effect, the “true laser” display technology developed by Hangzhou Zhongke aurora is also adopted. This technology takes three primary color laser as the light source, and is the only display technology that can fully realize the latest international standard of bt.2020.<br>At the same time, in order to make the audience in front of the screen of more electronic devices better enjoy the Winter Olympics. Based on the 5g SA network of China Unicom, the 5g broadcasting equipment of the Olympic Broadcasting Service Company (OBS) Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony has realized the full scene mobile video live broadcast on the dedicated bearer channel, presenting the high-definition full scene of the Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony.<br>Before the opening ceremony, China Unicom specially designed for the “bird’s nest” and carefully created a 5g SA network with 300MHz bandwidth and full coverage without dead corners. During the opening ceremony, “bird’s nest” achieved the fastest rate of 1.5gbps downlink and 500mbps uplink, making the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games the largest and fastest network bandwidth in the history of the Olympic Games.<br>At the same time, the Winter Olympics also conducted a comprehensive cloud operation for the first time. According to the official microblog of the International Olympic Committee, the Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be broadcast globally through Alibaba cloud. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games will last about 1000 hours. The total production of broadcast content will reach 6000 hours, and will be broadcast in 4K Ultra HD format for the first time. Some important events will also be broadcast in 8K format.<br>This is another major technological progress since the satellite TV broadcasting of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games began. Olympic Broadcasting can reach billions of audiences around the world through the Olympic Broadcasting cloud supported by Alibaba cloud.</p>
<h3 id="The-most-special-“person”"><a href="#The-most-special-“person”" class="headerlink" title="The most special “person”"></a>The most special “person”</h3><p>In the Winter Olympics, in addition to Gu ailing, Su Yiming and other sports stars, some special “people” participated in the whole process, which was popular.<br>For example, a 22-year-old Beijing girl “Dongdong” served as the publicity official of Alibaba digital Winter Olympics.<br>In fact, she is a real-time virtual digital person driven by artificial intelligence. Backed by Ali artificial intelligence technology, she has real-life facial expressions and body movements, and has first-class delivery ability.<br>In addition to winter and winter, there is also a “anchor” with a higher appearance rate. She is the first AI sign language anchor to be built by Baidu Intelligent Cloud Xi Ling digital human platform. At the current Olympic Games, she served as the virtual anchor of CCTV news AI sign language, reporting the news of the Winter Olympic Games and broadcasting the event sign language live.<br>CCTV news AI sign language anchor appeared in the Winter Olympics. Compared with real people, she may have the hand speed of “fire shadow knot fingerprint”. Some netizens commented: “Mr. Zhu has found a sign language anchor who can fight in the first World War”.<br>Baidu intelligent cloud has built a large scale sign language action library, and has refined nearly 10 thousand sign language actions. The accuracy of the AI sign language anchors is 98.5%, which makes AI professional ability not lose the real person.<br>With the development of science and technology, virtual digital human has attracted more and more attention. Li Shiyan, head of Baidu Intelligent Cloud AI Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, believes that the number of people has not yet reached the scale industry, because digital human production technology threshold is high, the cycle is long, and the cost is high.<br>The Winter Olympics is a carnival feast for many digital people enterprises, but when digital people can be fully commercialized may need more waiting.<br>In addition to the virtual digital human, this winter Olympics, from smart venue construction to service guarantee, artificial intelligence and robot technology are widely used.<br>For example, on the first day of the torch relay of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the underwater robot held the torch tightly at the mouth of the ice cave with a mechanical arm, approached the amphibious robot, and completed the relay within 10 seconds.<br>In addition, the disinfection and cleaning robot is responsible for cleaning and disinfection to help the epidemic prevention in the competition area.<br>Epidemic prevention robots, guidance robots, logistics robots, cooking robots and other intelligent robots have made great contributions to the whole Olympic Games, and people look forward to their application in life.</p>
<h3 id="Winter-Olympics-“support-group”"><a href="#Winter-Olympics-“support-group”" class="headerlink" title="Winter Olympics “support group”"></a>Winter Olympics “support group”</h3><p>At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Chinese athletes won 9 gold medals through hard work. The smooth progress of the fierce competition is also inseparable from the support of a large number of technology companies inside and outside the stadium.<br>First of all, when it comes to the game, we should mention sportswear. The official Winter Olympics uniforms and equipment are provided by Anta. In order to help all participants keep warm from the cold, Anta used two self-developed fabric technologies - hot technology and waterproof and moisture permeable technology.<br>By locking the heat, blazing technology can effectively prevent the loss of heat from the human body. High quality innovative materials and rigorous technology can achieve super warmth in the severe cold environment. Among them, the three-dimensional thermal insulation material poly thermal cotton has the performance of light and heat storage, and the blocking effect of heat loss is increased by about 20%. It can rise in temperature instantly and store heat efficiently. The use of far-infrared graphene material can significantly improve the far-infrared irradiation temperature rise, more than double the national standard.<br>In addition, super down is attached with a nano protective layer, which is waterproof and moisture-proof. At the same time, it increases the fluffy degree by 30% compared with ordinary down, so as to give better play to the long-term thermal effect of down and super warm.<br>Secondly, in terms of venue energy supply, the wind energy from Zhangbei, Hebei Province was transmitted to the three competition areas and 26 venues of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, realizing 100% green power supply for the first time in history. Shuguang computing power, as the “wind protection messenger” behind it, uses the new generation of domestic computing platform of Shuguang to provide computing power for Zhangbei power.<br>Dawning’s new generation of domestic computing platform provides a total of large-scale computing support services in fields such as wind, solar and electric power, making it possible for green energy to be more widely used, and has good development prospects under the goal of “double carbon”.<br>Back on the field, in order to ensure the smooth holding of the Winter Olympic Games, China Unicom launched 5g smart ambulance.<br>Its emergence has realized the continuous, real-time and multi-party cooperative remote first aid of “Winter Olympic site emergency vehicle support hospital”. In short, the medical staff on the ambulance can return the relevant data and information in the vehicle to the emergency center in real time through the 5g network in the vehicle. Hospital experts can see a doctor remotely through ultra-high definition video to achieve remote guidance and other measures.<br>Finally, as the official ticketing service partner of Beijing Winter Olympic Games, barley has achieved the goal of fully realizing the digital operation of ticketing.<br>On the eve of the closing ceremony, Timo Rumei, director of the television broadcasting and market development department of the IOC, who is responsible for Olympic ticketing affairs, said that the Beijing Winter Olympic ticketing system is the first digital ticketing system in Olympic history.<br>According to the Hong Kong Stock Research Institute, the system is based on cloud computing and digital technology, adopts Cloud Architecture, supports the cross regional deployment of Alibaba cloud’s global network, and can accommodate tens of millions of users online in real time. At the same time, the Olympic smart ticketing system is connected with the cloud computing power at a high speed, which can transmit and calculate in real time, and support the digital operation of multiple scenes such as cross seat drawing, automatic seat allocation and intelligent report. The service efficiency is five times higher than that of the traditional ticketing system.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>The Winter Olympics can be held smoothly, and the supporting lineup behind it can be described as “a gathering of stars”.<br>In addition to the above companies, there are more enterprises that provide relevant services and facilities for the Winter Olympic Games. For example, smart bed supplier Qisheng technology provides “weightless bed”; Dafeng Industrial Company provides competition intelligent system integration and overall solutions for sports venues related to the Winter Olympic Games; Nanshan Zhishang company participated in the design of Winter Olympics cold proof clothing and multi-functional clothing; Jinhyundai company participated in the construction of Beijing Winter Olympic power operation guarantee command platform project.<br>At the just concluded 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we saw the application of a large number of cutting-edge technologies. Enjoy the “most scientific and technological” Winter Olympics.<br>Many enterprises providing technical support behind the Olympic Games have demonstrated their strong scientific and technological strength.<br>Perhaps in the near future, whether it is “people” such as virtual digital people and intelligent robots, or 5g, cloud computing and other related technologies, after leaving the Olympic stage, they will eventually become meta universe games, holographic projection conferences, virtual digital people anchors and so on into our daily life.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:ganggushe, which is authorized by 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>The current situation of Haidilao fully shows that “opportunity” can also become a crisis.</p>
<h3 id="Huge-loss"><a href="#Huge-loss" class="headerlink" title="Huge loss"></a>Huge loss</h3><p>“The current bitter fruit can only be swallowed by ourselves”. On November 5, 2021, Haidilao released the store closure plan and the “woodpecker plan”, how big is the expansion “bitter fruit”? At present, this “bitter fruit” is enough to make it return to before liberation and return the total net profit of the company in the three years before listing to zero.<br>On the morning of February 21, Haidilao issued a profit warning, saying that compared with the net profit of 309 million yuan in 2020, it is expected to have a net loss of 3.8 billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan in 2021; At the same time, the revenue in 2021 is expected to exceed 40 billion yuan, an increase of more than 40% compared with the revenue of about 28.6 billion yuan in 2020.<br>This is the first annual loss of Haidilao since its listing in 2018. Affected by this announcement, Haidilao’s share price fell by 5.54% on the same day and closed at HK $19.08, a decrease of nearly 80% compared with the high of HK $85.80 in February last year, and the market value evaporated by about HK $350 billion.<br>For the gap between revenue and net profit, Haidilao said in its announcement that it was mainly caused by two reasons:<br>First, the one-time loss and impairment loss on the disposal of long-term assets caused by the closure of more than 300 restaurants and the decline of restaurant operating performance in 2021 totaled about RMB 3.3 billion to RMB 3.9 billion;<br>Second, the impact of global continuous changes and repeated epidemics, the rapid expansion of store network in 2020 and 2021 and the company’s internal management problems on the operation of Haidilao restaurant; Especially in the second half of 2021, the operation of Haidilao restaurant was significantly affected by the global regional epidemic outbreak and public health control measures, and its operating performance decreased compared with the second half of 2020. Overseas stores also experienced increased losses in 2021.<br>Although the impact of the epidemic has been mentioned many times in the announcement, it can be seen that the main cause of the performance loss of Haidilao is strategic error. In the first half of 2020, affected by the strictest epidemic situation and control, Haidilao lost 965 million yuan in net profit. After the recovery in the second half of the year, it turned loss into profit and gained 309 million yuan in net profit for the whole year. With the further relaxation of domestic epidemic control, if we follow the normal rhythm, the net profit in 2021 will increase on the basis of at least 309 million yuan. Why is there a serious loss?<br>The problem lies in contrarian expansion. Blind self-confidence, misjudgment of the epidemic situation, coupled with the temptation of preferential rent policies for shopping malls and properties, Haidilao “went against the trend and opened 544 new stores and restaurants when its performance was greatly impacted by the epidemic in 2020; In the first half of 2021, it continued to implement the aggressive expansion strategy and opened 299 stores. As of June 30, 2021, the total number of global stores of Haidilao was 1597.<br>The expansion of stores brought about a significant increase in costs and expenses, but the turnover rate and the average daily sales of the same store decreased one after another, and the company increased its income without increasing its profits. After realizing the problem, Haidilao decided to slow down, put on a sudden brake, and closed 300 stores successively in the second half of the year. Between opening and closing, the impact is not just the change in the number of stores. The one-time loss and impairment loss are as high as about 3.3 billion yuan to 3.9 billion yuan, accounting for 87% of the total estimated loss in 2021.<br>It is worth mentioning that in the first half of 2021 alone, Haidilao also obtained a net profit of 94.529 million yuan, that is, the estimated loss of 3.8-4.5 billion yuan was generated in the second half of the year.<br>Compared with its previous financial reports, from 2018 to 2020, Haidilao’s net profits were 1.646 billion yuan, 2.345 billion yuan and 309 million yuan respectively, with a total of about 4.3 billion yuan. It can be said that once it returned to before liberation, it lost the net profits of the three years before listing in half a year. It has to be said that Haidilao’s adverse expansion had a “bad effect”.</p>
<h3 id="hemostasis"><a href="#hemostasis" class="headerlink" title="hemostasis"></a>hemostasis</h3><p>In order to stop the loss in time, Haidilao adopted the strategy of “breaking the arm to stop bleeding”, launched the “woodpecker plan” on November 5, 2021, and closed more than 300 stores with poor performance before December 31, 2021, some of which are “suspended”, and will wait for the opportunity to reopen in the future, with a rest cycle of no more than two years; Rebuild and strengthen some functional departments and restore the regional management system; Timely shrink the group’s business expansion plan. If the average turnover rate of the group’s restaurant is lower than 4 times a day, in principle, new Haidilao restaurant will not be opened on a large scale.<br>Comparing the financial report data of four years after listing, we can see that the turnover rate of Haidilao is not ideal: in the first half of 2021, the turnover rate of Haidilao is three times a day, and from 2018 to 2020, the turnover rate is five times a day, 4.8 times a day and 3.5 times a day respectively, which has decreased for four consecutive years. The “woodpecker plan” refers to no less than four times a day, which means that it is difficult to return to the level before the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020 in the short term.<br>While Haidilao squatted down to “tie their shoelaces”, houlang changed the slow pace in the past and accelerated the pace of expansion. Among them, Guangdong style hotpot Laowang and Seafood Hotpot Qixin tianxiangji submitted prospectuses to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September 2021 and January 2022, intending to compete for the “third share of Hong Kong stock hotpot”. Both sides put forward ambitious expansion plans in the prospectus. According to the prospectus, as of the third quarter of 2021, the number of Qixin Tianmen stores was 250, and it is planned to open another 300 new stores in the three years from 2022 to 2024; At present, Laowang, which has less than 200 self operated stores, will also usher in a high outbreak period of stores, and plans to open 227 new stores in the next three years.<br>At the same time, the high-end hotpot brands of Yuxia Shimei and Yuxia Shimei, which are the same as the high-end hotpot brands of Yuxia Shimei in 2025, are positioned to be the same as the high-end hotpot brands of Yuxia Shimei in 2025. Although there is still a certain gap between the above brands and Haidilao in terms of volume and brand value, with the blessing of capital, they are eroding Haidilao’s market share and diluting its advantages.<br>Among them, Banu was a “follower” of Haidilao in its early days. Later, it occupied a place in the field of high-end hot pot with its own product and service advantages. At present, there are only about 85 Direct stores in China, and the customer unit price is dozens of yuan higher than Haidilao, but the grand situation of queuing in its stores in various cities is very similar to Haidilao in its early years, and its prospect is also optimistic by the industry.<br>According to Shen Boyuan, a consumer consulting expert, it is necessary for Haidilao to stop and rest at this time. The implementation of the “woodpecker plan” is correct and necessary. He said: “as long as the hotpot market still has a great opportunity to grow, the most urgent task for him is to regain its own advantages in terms of hotpot management.”<br>Of course, the operation of any enterprise is not smooth sailing. Many successful chain catering brands have experienced crises, and each crisis is a turnaround to a certain extent. Successful resolution will be a qualitative leap for enterprises.<br>After nearly 20 years of development, Haidilao has established a mature supply chain, products, management service system and brand value. These core assets give it the ability of sustainable development and are a solid guarantee for its breaking journey. It will take some time to verify whether the “woodpecker plan” can finally get Haidilao out of the dilemma and return to the peak. We might as well be more patient.<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:fbc180, author: Li Huanhuan, 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>The business of cross-border e-commerce is becoming more and more lively.<br>Recently, the official website of damonstudio, a cross-border women’s clothing independent station under byte beat, announced that damonstudio will stop operation from February 11, 2022. At this time, it is only more than three months since its domain name registration.<br>Damonstudio was founded against sheen, which has become a model for Internet giants to emulate since the cross-border e-commerce Unicorn sheen became popular all over the world. In addition, the company also expanded tiktok’s e-commerce team on a large scale in 2021, and launched the Independent E-commerce application Fanno overseas.<br>The overseas e-commerce road of byte beating reveals uncertainty and needs to continue to wait and see. However, during the same period when dmonstudio announced its shutdown, more players were eager to try.<br>On February 15, according to Xinyan finance, wechat recently tested a cross-border e-commerce applet “cloud shopping around the world” to try to connect overseas businesses with wechat users; On February 16, Reuters reported that sheen is actively expanding its Singapore office and has changed its actual holding company to Singapore company roadget business PTE.<br>After more than ten years of development, the hot land of cross-border e-commerce has gathered Internet giants such as Alibaba, jd.com and bytecode. Unicorns, listed enterprises and countless hot money have been born.<br>Favorable policies are introduced frequently. Since the Announcement No. 56 and 57 issued by the General Administration of Customs in 2014, the support of national and industrial policies has been increasing in the next few years.<br>At the beginning of 2022, cross-border e-commerce ushered in good news again - 27 new cross-border pilot zones will be established across the country, and the policy dividends will continue to be released.<br>However, with the support of all parties, the cross-border e-commerce field has not ushered in players who break through the siege. It was not until the birth of sheen in recent two years that a player who could tear a hole in the territory of e-commerce giant Amazon really appeared.<br>At the same time, in 2022, the rising cost of raw materials and the reduction of logistics efficiency of cross-border e-commerce continue. In the United States, India and other places, players will still be seriously affected by geography.<br>On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises, of which express was included for the first time.<br>How to eat the trillion cake of cross-border e-commerce in 2022?</p>
<h3 id="01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage"><a href="#01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage" class="headerlink" title="01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage"></a>01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage</h3><p>Internet giants’ exploration of cross-border e-commerce can be traced back to more than a decade ago.<br>At that time, with the gradual saturation of the domestic e-commerce industry, Internet giants invariably turned their attention to overseas markets.<br>Ali founded the online wholesale trading platform for the global market - Express in 2010, and wholly acquired American Vendio company to connect with express; JD’s cross-border exploration began in 2011, successively opening JD English station, Russian station and Spanish station to enter the overseas e-commerce market.<br>Before Alibaba founded express, domestic cross-border e-commerce experienced early development and realized a complete online transaction chain of transaction, payment and logistics. Lanting Jishi, Milan and other well-known cross-border e-commerce platforms have sprung up.<br>Lanting Jishi sells by self built stations, which is very similar to the independent station mode promoted later, while the opposite is the platform mode. The platform does not participate in the purchase and sales of goods, but the medium of transaction.<br>Lanting Jishi was listed in US stocks as early as 2013 and became the “first share of China’s cross-border e-commerce”. At that time, the development focus of most Chinese e-commerce enterprises was still at home, and the overseas e-commerce businesses of Alibaba and JD were also challenged.<br>In 2012, when Jingdong English station went online, Shi Tao, vice president of Jingdong Mall, once announced that it would achieve $100 million in Jingdong’s overseas business within three years, but after three years, Jingdong English station still didn’t improve. In the same period, Alibaba express was busy with the transformation, officially turning from C2C to B2C.<br>In the vast overseas, there is not much room for the development of Chinese enterprises. In 2009, the Sino US trade conflict began to take shape. In contrast, the European market has a relatively stable political environment and high consumption capacity, which is suitable for Chinese enterprises to achieve the goal of going to sea. This year, Lanting Jishi began to launch European sites, and a large number of enterprises began to pour into Europe. However, it is worth noting that at that time, high-end consumer markets such as Europe and the United States were mostly controlled by head players such as Amazon.<br>Chinese enterprises can only avoid the sharp edge of leading players such as Amazon and open up emerging markets in countries such as Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.<br>In recent years, cross-border e-commerce has flourished. According to Analysys data, the proportion of cross-border e-commerce in total foreign trade has increased year by year, from 15.71% in 2017 to 22.03% in October 2021. From January to October 2021, the scale of cross-border e-commerce industry reached 6.98 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 25.47%.<br>However, although the cross-border e-commerce industry has experienced a dividend period of rapid development and an elimination period of fierce competition in the past decade, the market is still savage.<br>For a long time, the services of those platforms that seem to be successful are not mature. The distribution timeliness of overseas e-commerce was once very backward. Sellers were used to “selling winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter”.<br>It was not until recent years that Chinese e-commerce enterprises began to expand their business scope. Expand from overseas warehouses and third-party warehouses to self owned logistics networks and cross-border e-commerce industrial parks, rather than focusing on online sites as in the early days. The delivery time has been much faster, but it has only been delivered within 7 days to “72 hours” in a few urban areas.<br>The multinational home-based restrictions under the influence of the epidemic in 2020 once led to the outbreak of online sales. However, after 2021, behind a series of events such as “one container is difficult to find” of port containers, cross-border e-commerce has experienced the phenomenon of rising costs of logistics, raw materials and tariffs, difficulties in customs clearance and inspection, and reduced logistics efficiency. The difficult situation of small and medium-sized sellers has also slowed down the growth of the platform.<br>Geopolitical influence is also intensifying. On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises. In addition to including express for the first time, Dunhuang, a cross-border e-commerce platform, was “named” again this year. The impact is not limited to the United States. There have been media reports that Ali’s international business in India is still shrinking.<br>After a long time of model exploration, the road of overseas e-commerce of giants is still difficult and far from reaching the harvest period.</p>
<h3 id="02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode"><a href="#02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode" class="headerlink" title="02 “second spring” of independent station mode"></a>02 “second spring” of independent station mode</h3><p>Independent station is nothing new, but it still rises rapidly in 2020 and continues to be hot in 2022, attracting giants and capital to bet.<br>Sheen, which started in Ningbo, became a blockbuster and became the most installed shopping app in the United States by surpassing Amazon. The rise of sheen is inseparable from its flexible supply chain system, social media marketing ability and China’s tax relief for cross-border e-commerce.<br>It is worth noting that sheen is an independent ecological station.<br>According to Bloomberg, sheen achieved $10 billion in sales in 2020, a year-on-year increase of more than 250%. In this ecosystem, only one of them can achieve an annual revenue of 10 billion US dollars.<br>This also means that the ecology of the independent station has not been fully reclaimed.<br>The rise of independent stations is closely related to the progress of SaaS station building system technology. The construction threshold and cost of the website are reduced, so that sellers can realize the most basic website construction for thousands of yuan. By selecting more third-party plug-in services, sellers can also obtain services at a low cost.<br>This year, the field of cross-border e-commerce SaaS is still developing rapidly. In January 2022, JD group announced its cooperation with Shopify. JD will open a commodity pool based on JD supply chain network for Shopify global merchants through DTC independent station. It can be seen that SaaS tools support cross-border e-commerce platforms. In the same month, the global e-commerce independent station SaaS platform shopkeeper technology announced that it had completed a C1 round of financing with a total amount of US $150 million, which was led by Softbank vision phase II fund. In the past two years, cross-border e-commerce SaaS service providers have also continued to be hot.<br>Compared with the threshold and cost, what can attract sellers more is the private domain traffic created by independent stations. At present, mainstream platforms such as Amazon and express are gradually crowded, with fierce competition among sellers, difficult access to public domain traffic and high cost.<br>A large number of cross-border e-commerce platforms are attacking cities and territories with the main low price strategy, which also leads to the pressure on their revenue and profits. When they encounter market changes, these platforms are also the first to be affected. Last November, vova, known as “European pinduoduo”, encountered tens of thousands of sellers to protect their rights because of “running away”.<br>For sellers, independent stations still have dividends, which is more likely to give birth to the story of “sudden wealth”.<br>Overseas short video social platforms can also guide these sites. In particular, the rise of new traffic platforms such as tiktok has increased the traffic channels of overseas sellers.<br>However, these traffic platforms may also have their own “ideas”. From tiktok e-commerce to dmonstudio and Fanno, we have never given up the business of cross-border e-commerce. At the end of last year, Zhang Yiming mentioned in his internal objectives that further exploration will be focused on three new business directions in 2021, including cross-border e-commerce.<br>Not only tiktok, Facebook’s exploration in the field of e-commerce has never stopped. When social media starts to make e-commerce layout, with strong users as the basis of e-commerce business, it is difficult for those independent station players not to have a sense of crisis.<br>No one can predict whether the independent station is the end of cross-border e-commerce or just a small stone to the market. The development of independent station mode still needs to wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future"><a href="#03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?"></a>03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?</h3><p>Chinese players want to attack the cross-border e-commerce market. Their biggest opponents are not only Amazon and other players who occupy the market, but also the dramatically changing overseas market environment. How to overcome obstacles and win overseas is still a difficult problem.<br>The rapid development of live e-commerce overseas has shown players a new way.<br>The development of overseas live broadcast e-commerce is relatively late. In 2019, Amazon launched the live broadcast function. Last year, social platforms such as Facebook and instagram launched live delivery. This year, Amazon and other e-commerce giants, Facebook and other social media are still overweight live e-commerce.<br>As the market is still in its infancy, the development of live e-commerce business of local giants is also relatively slow, which is the opportunity for Chinese players.<br>At present, Kwai Tong and TikTok have begun the layout of overseas direct seeding providers, and the fast hands also say that they will accelerate the development of live broadcasting business overseas.<br>However, this road is not so easy. Tiktok rarely mentioned live data. Foreign media reported that tiktok had conducted two live shopping activities with Wal Mart, but the viewing data was not ideal.<br>On the one hand, overseas users are not familiar with the mode of live shopping. On the other hand, the current common dilemma of cross-border e-commerce is that it relies on popular single products to promote sales, and the brand attribute is secondary, which also leads to the difficulty of selecting products for live shopping.<br>Previously, in the best-selling list of Amazon and express, the old and new products changed quickly, while most of the products at the top had no brands, so they were easy to be replaced and eliminated.<br>This is also the embodiment of these platforms chasing category dividends. Compared with product capabilities, they rely more on operation means. In the long run, cross-border e-commerce platforms should strengthen brand attributes while building explosive products.<br>In addition, in the field of e-commerce, business flow and logistics are indispensable.<br>In recent years, China’s logistics enterprises are also speeding up going to sea. In 2021 alone, most players entered the game.<br>In May 2021, Zhongtong international realized that the normal time limit for customs clearance and delivery in Yangon, Myanmar was “72 hours”, and the whole territory distribution was an additional day; At the end of June, Yuantong International’s freight routes were expanded to East Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan, and South and Southeast Asian countries such as Pakistan; In September, SF holdings completed the acquisition of 51.5% equity of Kerry Logistics; In October, Baishi joined hands with Changhong to explore the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia.<br>Their participation can provide the underlying logistics foundation for the cross-border e-commerce platform. In addition, the cross-border e-commerce platform itself also pays close attention to building a global logistics network, so as to provide strong support for the development of overseas e-commerce business.<br>An earlier batch of cross-border e-commerce companies have begun to build their own overseas warehouses. Although this will cause enterprises to spend a lot of costs and occupy a lot of working capital, once the overseas warehouses become large-scale, it will help the platform strengthen the supervision of merchants’ product quality, and ensure the reliable source of products when cooperating with brands. More importantly, it will also greatly reduce the logistics time.</p>

          <p>From the end of 2021 to the beginning of 2022, in addition to Qualcomm Xiaolong 8 Gen 1 becoming the talk capital of digital enthusiasts after dinner, ltpo, a relatively unfamiliar “word”, was also repeatedly put on the table. In addition to having enough voice among geeks, mobile phone brands even talked about this technology in equal length with performance at several press conferences at the end of the year.<br>On the stage, manufacturers are in high spirits to publicize the “power saving” advantages of mobile phones after their adoption of ltpo technology.<br>Under the stage, consumers will still face various problems of power consumption, jamming and battery life when using Android phones.<br>Ltpo is to reduce unnecessary power consumption by “adaptive” refresh frame rate while maintaining high screen refresh, so as to achieve the purpose of power saving.<br>However, the ideal is full and the reality is skinny.<br>On the one hand, mobile phone manufacturers have different scheduling for third-party app software. If they make good software scheduling by using ltpo characteristics, they can indeed reduce some power loss of mobile phones in specific scenarios; But if it is not done well, it will not only consume electricity, but also increase the sense of visual fragmentation, which is equivalent to a double-edged sword.<br>In addition, if you want to perfectly adapt the third-party app, manufacturers need to spend a lot of energy. After all, the number base of commonly used software is huge, and the characteristics of each software are different. Where to reduce the frame rate, where to maintain high refresh, how to switch the frame rate of the secondary and tertiary switching interface, how to minimize the sense of cleavage, and so on, all need to be deeply adapted.<br>On the other hand, for game scenes where large power consumers need to maintain a high refresh frame rate, ltpo can play a very limited role.<br>Why can various mobile terminal manufacturers still carry out crazy publicity like ltpo as a baby? Even ltpo has not become the standard configuration of mobile phones. Ltpo 2.0 came. It seems that without ltpo, it is not enough for the flagship mobile phone standard.</p>
<h3 id="Where-is-the-ltpo-artifact"><a href="#Where-is-the-ltpo-artifact" class="headerlink" title="Where is the ltpo artifact?"></a>Where is the ltpo artifact?</h3><p>Users interested in screen display technology should be familiar with the current mainstream screen materials. At present, the mainstream screen materials are OLED and LCD. These two screens have their own advantages and disadvantages in mobile terminals.<br>No matter LCD or OLED, all mobile terminal manufacturers have long regarded screen refresh as the main selling point. In this new equipment track, the higher the screen refresh rate, the more able anyone can occupy the high-end voice.<br>However, the following problem is that if you always maintain a high refresh rate, the pressure on the processor and battery load are problems. How can you not only ensure the refresh rate, but also reduce unnecessary power loss and make the mobile phone more power-saving?<br>Screen material pictures from the network<br>Dynamic refresh may be the key “method” to solve this problem. Let the screen respond to “on-demand changes” according to the user’s use scene. For example, when playing a movie, it can be displayed in 24 frames; When reading books or comics, 1 frame is displayed; When sliding the page, it can run in 60 frames or even 120 frames.<br>At this time, ltpo appeared, which is fully called “low temperature polycrystalline oxidation”.<br>In fact, it can not be regarded as a new technology. Apple watch 4 has taken the lead in adopting variable refresh screen, which can be instantaneously increased from constant 1Hz to 60Hz when waking up.<br>Both Apple watch 5 and apple watch 4 support ltpo. Pictures are from Apple’s official website<br>Ltpo is a “hybrid” solution applied to OLED TFT backplane. To understand this technology, we must first talk about the mainstream TFT backplane technology.<br>At present, TFTs used in portable devices mainly include a-Si, LTPS and igzo. A-Si is called amorphous silicon. Because of its low cost and high yield, this material is widely used in mobile screen display, covering high, medium and low price products in the early stage. However, the carrier mobility related to the advantages and disadvantages of TFT and display power consumption is only 0.3-1 cm ²&#x2F; V · s (the higher the data, the more power saving).<br>With the upgrading of technology iteration and consumer demand, low-temperature polysilicon materials are slowly moving towards the main stage, namely LTPS. In addition to the power consumption advantage brought by high mobility and reduced driving voltage, the response speed is also fast, but the yield is low and the cost is high, which limits the large screen equipment to carry this technology.<br>It is necessary to mention promotion on iPad pro. This product does not use LTPS material, but igzo with carrier mobility of only one tenth of the former. On the one hand, due to cost considerations, on the other hand, due to the characteristics of igzo itself, its leakage is also better than LTPS, and the refresh rate is more stable.<br>As the name suggests, ltpo is a technology that forms oxide layer on LTPS layer through a series of technologies. It not only has the characteristics of high mobility and low power consumption of LTPS, but also has the characteristics of low refresh stability and low leakage of igzo. In a simple analogy, ltpo is equivalent to combining the advantages of the two materials.<br>In addition, public research data show that ltpo can reduce the power consumption of terminal equipment by 5% - 15%. Although the paper data is beautiful, it actually depends on the specific use scenario. For the power consumption without the use scenario, it is of little significance to users.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-ltpo-and-what-is-ltpo-2-0"><a href="#What-is-ltpo-and-what-is-ltpo-2-0" class="headerlink" title="What is ltpo and what is ltpo 2.0"></a>What is ltpo and what is ltpo 2.0</h3><p>At present, the change of ltpo 2.0 in hardware technology is not obvious. “2.0” emphasizes more like “optimization” for different use scenarios. In other words, ltpo 2.0 may make users feel ltpo technology. Different from the “unified caliber” of various manufacturers when ltpo first came out, ltpo 2.0 is more like the product of “in-depth customization”, which can be understood as the technology after hardware + software optimization.<br>If different frequencies are displayed in different scenes, such as running at 120 frames when brushing microblog; When watching a movie, it runs at 24 movie standard frames; When reading articles, it is not difficult to display them in 10 frames or less.<br>Liu fengshuo microblog picture from microblog<br>The difficulty is how to balance the scheduling frame rate when displaying content and touching fingers.<br>Each company’s frame rate scheduling logic for ltpo 2.0 is different. On the 12 series, Xiaomi will not only dynamically adjust the refresh rate in different scenes in the conventional application, but also realize sliding speed change according to the speed of the finger sliding the screen. The one plus ltpo 2.0, according to them, is the real ltpo 2.0.<br>Liu fengshuo of Yijia also said on his microblog: “it’s not a thing. In addition to being customized with Samsung, Yijia’s ltpo 2.0 includes a large number of self-developed technology applications, which makes the screen experience a new height in many aspects”.<br>Yijia pointed out that the current problem encountered by ltpo is that the recognition of complex superimposed scenes is low and the matching speed is not fast enough. For example, typing scenes are used every day in daily life. Generally, the system will detect that this is a “typing” requirement, so it will increase the frame rate to 120 frames, but the problem is that it does not need to be maintained at 120 frames all the time. With the advantage of ltpo 2.0, it can dynamically adjust the number of frames according to the screen display content while detecting the scene, increase the frame rate to a high frame rate at the moment of typing and reduce it to 1 frame at the moment of leaving.<br>The refresh rate pictures under different applications of Xiaomi come from Xiaomi<br>However, in this millisecond, can the additional power consumption reduced be really perceived?<br>According to the friends around us and the measured data, the equipment using ltpo 2.0 does not save much power. In addition, it is not difficult to see from the measured data in the rice evaluation of digital bloggers that there is no gap between the models equipped with ltpo and ordinary mobile phones in terms of endurance.<br>The picture comes from the screenshot of rice evaluation video<br>Rice said in the ltpo 2.0 evaluation: “from the perspective of power saving, ltpo does a good job. To a certain extent, it does save power, but there is still a big question mark on how much this part of power consumption improves the overall life of the mobile phone.”. For some heavy mobile game players, the cliff like decline of power can be intuitively experienced.<br>Whether it’s ltpo or lpto 2.0, it’s in a “sleep” state when facing the game scene.</p>
<h3 id="Is-the-gospel-of-deep-game-lovers-an-independent-display-chip"><a href="#Is-the-gospel-of-deep-game-lovers-an-independent-display-chip" class="headerlink" title="Is the gospel of deep game lovers an independent display chip?"></a>Is the gospel of deep game lovers an independent display chip?</h3><p>Mobile phone brands such as black shark and iqoo, which are deeply loved by heavy mobile game players, have “found a new way” to achieve the purpose of “reducing power consumption” by adding hardware, that is, an independent display chip is built in the mobile phone.<br>In fact, this is not to install “independent display chip” in mobile phones after the large-scale popularization of smart phones.<br>As early as 2007, NVIDIA launched geforce 5500 for mobile phones, which can realize high-specification video decoding, support high-resolution and 3D game performance, but it failed to give full play to the strength of this chip due to the function and game software support.<br>Black Shark mobile phone 2 Pro picture from black shark official website<br>Therefore, this business strategy soon ended in failure.<br>Today, 15 years later, mobile games are developing rapidly. High capacity, high image quality and multiple people on the same screen are a major trend, which is a big test for the current mobile phone performance. When running games such as original God and call of duty mobile game version, the mobile phone processor is often required to “run under full load”, which brings additional heat and battery loss to the mobile phone.<br>How to ensure high refresh while reducing load loss is the biggest headache for mobile phone manufacturers. At this time, independent display chips come in handy.<br>Taking iqoo 9 Pro as an example, the function principle of high frame and low power consumption mode is to double the overall number of frames by only rendering half the number of frames by GPU, and then inserting frames. For example, rendering 45 frames to achieve 90 frames and 60 frames to achieve 120 frames. This can not only improve the picture fluency, but also make the mobile phone in a low load state. The mode of increasing the frame rate is to insert one frame into the two pictures of the low frame game to enhance the fluency on the original basis.<br>The independent display chip is mainly used in mobile phones to improve the frame rate<br>Judging from the recent launch of the flagship new machine equipped with Qualcomm 8, some manufacturers have begun to adopt the dual hardware configuration of ltpo + independent display chip. In the public use scenario, the ltpo mechanism is used to achieve the purpose of power saving; In the entertainment scene, the independent display chip is used to further reduce the power consumption.<br>Iqoo 9 Pro is a flagship machine rarely using ltpo and independent display chip<br>This seems to be one of the few “hard core” ways to improve the endurance performance of mobile phones.<br>Unfortunately, the screen resolution of ordinary scenes can be adjusted adaptively, and the GPU load of game scenes can be reduced, but the Android GPU is still running at a high speed.<br>If the GPU processor is “synchronized” with the screen refresh, it will increase or decrease instantaneously, which will lead to sensory jamming or image tearing. Therefore, in order to “maintain stability”, the GPU has to be fixed in the high-frequency operation state.<br>Apple’s ltpo performs in-depth matching from processor system UI. Of course, this is also due to the good power consumption control of the processor itself. Ltpo is “icing on the cake”.<br>In other words, if Android does not carry out forced control and deep adaptation from the “core” root, even if the refresh frame rate scheduling is more accurate and the switching between different applications is more smooth, the dynamic adjustment of the screen becomes better than nothing due to the large power consumption of the processor itself.<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:pinwancool, which is authorized by lzh, 36 krypton.</p>
