          <p>A dream.<br>On February 21, the day after the Winter Olympics, Migu video fell to No. 52 in the free app list (iPhone end) of Diandian data platform.<br>This is still the result of the short rise after the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. On the day before the closing ceremony, Migu video has fallen to No. 88, and the ranking tends to return to about 200 before the Winter Olympics.<br>Before that, Migu video had just spent two weeks of “suddenly like the spring breeze of one night”.<br>On the first day of spring and the opening day of the Winter Olympics, the dau (number of daily active users) of Migu video increased by 2.7 million. In the subsequent schedule, its dau remained at about 11 million, almost double that before the Winter Olympics. From February 5 to 9, in the general list of Diandian data free app (iPhone), Migu video jumped from the top 200 to the second, followed by the central video.<br>The reason for topping the list is simple: Migu video and central video are the only platform for “two” users to watch the whole live broadcast of the event on the mobile terminal. Compared with the central video, Migu video also has one more hand - Wang Meng, a former Olympic champion and now a Winter Olympic commentator with “eyes like a ruler”.<br>However, as the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, the number of users of Migu video began to decline. On February 9 and 11, its daily life fell by 11.26% and 11.24% respectively… Until it returned to the situation before the Winter Olympics before and after the closing ceremony.<br>This scene also appeared at the 2018 World Cup. In 2022, after the warm wind at the beginning of spring, will Migu video go out of the cycle of ending the season and maintaining the same traffic?</p>
<h3 id="01-Migu-video-performance-competition"><a href="#01-Migu-video-performance-competition" class="headerlink" title="01 Migu video performance competition"></a>01 Migu video performance competition</h3><p>In the broadcast “field” of this winter Olympic Games, Migu video has almost no opponent like existence.<br>Migu video is one of the few “players” who can stand on the field according to whether they have the broadcasting right or not.<br>The central television broadcasting station said in the statement of copyright protection of Winter Olympic Games: the video platform that won the broadcasting rights of this winter Olympic Games is only three Kwai goo videos, Tencent and fast hands. Further observation will show that Tencent and Kwai have only the right to live broadcast live, that is to say, if you want to watch the live broadcast of the whole event, the mobile terminal users have only two choices: Central video (CCTV) and Mi Gu video.<br>Facts have proved that the two platforms did have bright data after the Winter Olympics. Baidu Index shows that since February 4, the search indexes of both have increased significantly and remained at a high level for several days. During this period, the search index of “aiyouteng” three platforms was flat or decreased. Little data shows that the estimated downloads of Migu video increased by 13.5 times month on month in the first week of the Winter Olympics.<br>In the second step of seizing the leading position, Migu video relies on explaining this card. During the Winter Olympics, former Olympic champion Wang Meng, who served as Migu video commentary, repeatedly boarded the microblog hot search and contributed golden sentences such as “my eyes are feet”. On the day after Wang Meng finished his last interpretation of the Winter Olympics, as of February 17, the total number of topics read by microblog # Wang Meng interpretation # reached 2.67 billion, exceeding 2.57 billion of Gu Ailing’s gold medal.<br>Wang Meng’s out of the circle has also further driven the data growth of Migu video. Many users said in the comment area that “because of Wang Meng, Download Migu video and recharge members”. Coincidentally, the two significant increases of Migu video Baidu Index also appeared on the day after Wang Mengyin explained the circle, one of which was “my eyes are feet”, and the other came from a clear and clear explanation of the reasons for the foul committed by Hungarian players in men’s short track 1000m speed skating.<br>The share price of China Mobile, the gold owner behind Migu video, was also boosted. On the same day, the share price of China Dongling mobile rose by 68% for the first time, and a shares of China Dongling mobile rose by 15.2% in June.</p>
<h3 id="“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast"><a href="#“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast" class="headerlink" title="“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast"></a>“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast</h3><p>The sports broadcasting business that Migu video has bet heavily is actually a hard bone that many platforms can’t attack for a long time.<br>LETV sports, Suning sports, Tencent video and Sports Olympic power were all important players on the card table. In October 2014, when the broadcasting rights of sports events were liberalized, the momentum of the Olympic Games was 8 billion for the 5 years, the most colorful footnote in the market bubble.<br>However, the high copyright fees and slow and rare returns of sports events have also become a heavy burden on video platforms. Sun Hongbin, an investor of LETV sports and founder of rongchuang, once said at the 2016 performance conference that “LETV spent 1.35 billion last year (2016) and only received 50 million in total.”<br>Finally, the platforms with heavy positions in sports broadcasting rights may be dragged down, or choose to shrink the cost and protect themselves.<br>Migu video has been able to carry it up to now, due to its ingenious admission time, the financial and technical support of China Mobile behind it, and a lighter operation mode.<br>In 2018, when the video came into the market, the market bubble of sports copyright had gradually dissipated, and copyright prices had dropped sharply. Wei Jianglei, former senior vice president of sina.com, said in an interview with the media at the end of 2017: “on the whole, the copyright price is much lower than the high point, and the gap is three to five times.”<br>If the good admission time makes Migu video account for “Tianshi”, the support of the parent company China Mobile has created a “favorable location”.<br>From the perspective of financial strength, Migu video, backed by China Mobile, has obvious financial advantages compared with other platforms, which has also become the foundation for it to buy a large number of sports copyrights.<br>Supporting Migu video’s entry into sports broadcasting is also in line with China Mobile’s own development interests. In its music, video, reading and other businesses, sports event broadcasting is obviously the best way to give full play to its 5g network advantages.<br>In addition to the support of the sponsor, Migu video also makes careful calculations on the cost side - different from the self built studio and self broadcasting of sports live broadcasting platforms such as Tencent live broadcasting and PP live broadcasting, the outsourcing of broadcasting work is Migu’s “magic weapon” for saving money.<br>Southern Weekend quoted a number of insiders as saying that after purchasing the copyright, Migu did not broadcast directly by itself, but outsourced the broadcasting work to a third-party company. The latter adds the live room signal, loads the subtitles, and then pushes it to Migu platform. In other words, Migu video only provides a viewing platform. This method effectively saves costs, such as the cost of expensive studio, live broadcasting equipment, specially assigned personnel to maintain equipment, as well as the vacancy cost during the off-season.<br>Different from the careful calculation of broadcasting, Migu video has been laid out in the field of interpretation for a long time, and has always been a great deal of investment in the interpretation team. This is also the background of the “Wang Meng phenomenon” in this winter Olympic Games.<br>Last year’s Tokyo Olympic Games, Migu video invited more than 100 hosts and guests, including 30 well-known sports commentators, 12 Olympic champions and 20 world champions. The interpretation team of the Winter Olympics is even better, with more than 150 commentators and guests.<br>In addition, in the selection of commentators, Migu video has formed its own playing method - try to choose popular guests who are easy to break the circle or bring their own traffic to explain. Wang Meng, who made frequent golden sentences, Chen Chen, the track and field commentator known as the “human computer” at the Tokyo Olympic Games, and Lu Han in the European Cup final.<br>Having tasted the dividends brought by the “interpretation circle” for many times, Migu video prepared the live broadcast team of this winter Olympic Games early. Wang Meng was one of the first guests invited by Migu video. In January this year, Migu video went online to select the variety “boiling! Commentator” for sports commentary, so as to reserve strength for its commentary team. Wang Meng participated in it at that time.<br>Relying on the deep interpretation team, Migu video further strengthens the interaction between users and the platform. In the Winter Olympics, Migu provided a variety of interpretation combinations for users to choose from, and even specially set up Cantonese interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="03-a-game-a-dream"><a href="#03-a-game-a-dream" class="headerlink" title="03 a game, a dream?"></a>03 a game, a dream?</h3><p>But the story of users leaving after the event is repeated.<br>With the Winter Olympics coming to an end, the download volume of Migu video has continued to decline, even lower than the average value in recent months from February 12 to February 19. It seems that with the end of Wang Meng’s interpretation, the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, and users are gradually “leaving” from Migu.<br>This is reminiscent of the ups and downs of its past events. According to the annual report of China Mobile, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, 4.3 billion people watched the game through Migu video client. However, the monthly active number fell by 11.35% in the four months after the event. In the month following the end of the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, the monthly activity of Migu video fell by 32.28%.<br>The situation of heavy gold and water is also happening in Kwai Fu. Kwai tiktok is the only platform to get the right to broadcast and return the Winter Olympic Games in the short video platform. However, in a number of media reports, Kwai 2 billion 500 million has been betting on the two Olympic Games (Tokyo Olympic Games and Beijing Winter Olympic Games).<br>The strategy adopted by Kwai in this winter Olympic Games is to upload and replay, and update the old ways of medal list and schedule in time. But tiktok, which is the short video platform, has been overtaking by tiktok, relying on the introduction of sports stars. Especially the early popularity of Gu Ailing and Su Yi Ming has greatly boosted the activity of the jitter during the Winter Olympics. During the Winter Olympics, the downloads of the Kwai Po were even lower than January’s average downloads.<br>Just like the fast hand picked the wrong operation strategy, there is obviously a shortage of the long video strategy of the microkwai video.<br>At present, Migu, standing on the video platform track, chooses the strategy of focusing on sports and supplemented by film and television dramas. But the question is, during the off-season, what does Migu video take to retain users?<br>At present, Migu video platform is like a collection of major video platforms, presenting content from Mango TV, iqiyi, Tencent video, etc. This may be related to its strategy of purchasing copyright from other platforms. In November 2021, Migu video also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with mango hypermedia with a cooperation amount of no less than 3.5 billion yuan within three years.<br>However, from the playback volume data, users are still more inclined to chase dramas on the original video platform.<br>Obviously, non exclusive content can make up for the shortcomings of Migu video in the content pool, but it can not distinguish Migu video from other video platforms. As a result, Migu video is like the user’s “monthly throwing” app, which is “abandoned” by the user immediately after the end of the competition for one to two months.<br>From the perspective of event broadcasting rights, Migu has few hands, including the broadcasting rights of Qatar world cup from November to December 2022 and China Asian Cup from June to July 2023.<br>For Migu, sports copyright has proved to be an excellent breakthrough direction, but it is not a bottomless moat. After all, it is the event itself rather than the platform that attracts the audience.<br>Relying on the rich and powerful gold owner, it is true that he can get a good hand of cards, but after the cards are played, for Migu video, which is absent in the field of entertainment, variety, film and television and other original content, how to retain the influx of users during the season is a beautiful problem that needs to be considered most.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:xuebaocaijingshe, and is published by Gao Xuyang, 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>E-commerce platforms and logistics companies have been “in love and killing each other” for a long time.<br>The rise of e-commerce has promoted the rapid development of the express market towards maturity, and the industry has gradually cleared up. Small express enterprises have exited one after another. In this process, the reconstruction of the supply chain by e-commerce mode has reduced the cost of logistics in commodity sales and further suppressed the profitability of express.<br>However, logistics is also the lifeblood of e-commerce. The reason is that e-commerce must eventually fall to the stage of competitive services. The timeliness of distribution and terminal distribution capacity related to terminal services determine that logistics has become an important link connecting consumers.<br>The above “competition and cooperation” relationship has been highlighted in the development of e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, jd.com and pinduoduo.<br>Tiktok is a situation of tripartite confrontation between overweeningly ambitious businesses and the need for logistics.<br>Recently, the voice of the tiktok has been distributing frequently. It is said that according to a person close to byte beat, byte has completed its investment in polar rabbit express to supplement the e-commerce puzzle and expand the layout of overseas e-commerce.<br>It is self-evident that the message is not true, but the position of bytes to make up logistics services is self-evident. Tiktok said.<br>In addition, in January 12th, according to media reports, the voice tiktok opened the test express service “Yin Zun Da”, providing door-to-door service. It is reported that the service has been experienced by some merchants.<br>From these actions, the pace of building e-commerce closed loop is accelerating.<br>For e-commerce platforms, there are two ways to supplement logistics services:<br>First, build a self built logistics platform, and then replace the original third-party services; Second, it is highly integrated with the information system of logistics partners to improve operation efficiency and reduce operation costs.<br>In China, JD chose the self operated mode, while Alibaba chose the integrated mode.<br>Since rookie is the only way to build a closed loop for e-commerce, there are also rookies and Jingdong pearl Yu before. Then, which way will tiktok e-commerce choose? Or is it a self reliant Mountain Gate?</p>
<h3 id="01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease"><a href="#01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease" class="headerlink" title="01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease"></a>01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease</h3><p>Last August 1st, Zhang bought a garment on the tiktok platform, and the company promised to deliver the goods within 7-10. But wait until the 10 showed the delivery information. He could not wait to check the order again. He found the order showed that “your parcel is being blocked because it is being blocked.”<br>At that time, Zhang felt quite strange. On the premise that he did not receive any express, and in the previous communication with the express company, he did not mention rejecting the express, so the package was returned for no reason.<br>Zhang hang then dialed the manual customer service number of the express company that delivered the goods. The customer service showed that the merchant intercepted the express delivery, resulting in the return of the package.<br>Tiktok, who was unhappy, came to the shaking platform to find out the problem of the artificial customer service, but the way of dealing with the other side was not satisfactory. He only proposed the way to compensate tens of dollars of coupons. Through this, Zhang kept hesitating about shopping on the tiktok platform.<br>Meanwhile, Li Hong, who sold ceramic products on the shaking platform, received 6 tiktok notices in 9 days. The reasons for the violation were the exception of the express order or express logistics track uploaded to the background.<br>Li Hong’s shop was also punished accordingly. A total of 4000 yuan of deposit and 30 points of store credit were deducted. The shop was closed for three days.<br>In this regard, Li Hong felt very aggrieved. After all the orders in the store were real delivery, repeatedly communicated with the customer service to ask how to appeal, and applied for a sealed certificate from the logistics network, the appeal still ended in failure.<br>Up to now, Li Hong still cannot accept the above punishment.<br>An independent e-commerce department was established in 618 in 2020, followed by the external chain removal activity; And then tiktok payment on-line, shaking tiktok completes the payment closed loop; And even put forward the concept of interest in electricity providers, impact trillion GMV, the voice of the voice tiktok into a public eye in a vigorous gesture.<br>But now, whether or not it is admitted, logistics has gradually become the Achilles heel of the tiktok electric provider.<br>Tiktok itself is aware of this. Official data show that the distribution of service delivery problems in the tiktok and the express delivery service account for more than 50%.<br>In addition, the problem of terminal delivery can directly affect the user shopping experience, and will further affect the user’s repeat purchase. It will have a negative impact on businesses and users. This may be partly because of the fact that the chattering has been a tight lipped answer to the tiktok rate.<br>Tiktok, however, is considered to be generally weaker than expected in the near term.<br>Tiktok, raise a Babel of criticism of the noisy service, the company will provide door-to-door delivery, terminal delivery, terminal complaints, parcel priority transfer, exclusive service and other benefits.<br>Through these measures, tiktok intention reduces the rate of complaint and reversion rate of consumers.<br>According to snow leopard financial services, at present, Yin Zun Da is still in the water trial state. The voice only recommends that merchants buy some Yin Yin for some orders, and the recommended proportion is no more than 3% of the tiktok per day.<br>It should be noted that in this link, although the shaking is raising the importance of the terminal delivery, the initiative of the business lies in the business. In fact, whether the service premium is borne by the tiktok, whether the subsidy is transferred to the consumers, or whether the business platform will be transferred to consumers, needs further observation.<br>More importantly tiktok is essentially a service launched by tiktok and express delivery companies such as Zhong Tong, Tantong, rhyme, etc., and the jitter only plays a role in resource integration, and its intervention capability on the express platform is weak, and the effectiveness needs to be tested.</p>

After the group visit, President Kang Zeyu said that at present, the voice business is not doing warehousing, logistics, nor has it planned to build warehousing and logistics itself.<br>But Kang Zeyu’s denial cannot stand up in the face of facts.<br>Today, on the official recruitment website, there are 74 positions related to “logistics”, including R &amp; D, operation, product and functional positions, involving e-commerce supply chain, logistics middle office and other fields.<br>For rookie tiktok, logistics is very necessary, but there are rookie and Jingdong pearl Yu in front:<br>The former is positioned as a social logistics integrator based on Alibaba retail platform, which complements an important link in Alibaba’s performance network by integrating express companies and route transportation enterprises;<br>The latter is positioned as an integrated logistics service provider, which has established its own supply chain service advantages in the mode of warehouse distribution, and user experience has become its core competitiveness.<br>Therefore, “copying homework” has become a ready-made shortcut.<br>In May 2021, according to Tech planet, the voice and electricity business of logistics tiktok came to many former P9 supply chain &#x2F; logistics personnel. The new ones who left the company from Ali were Wang Wei, Ou Liyong, He Chuan.<br>Rookie tiktok logistics business is coming to the rookie logistics as it is visible after the P talent is coming.<br>Tiktok, tiktok, tiktok tiktok, a video of the voice of the business platform, was circulated online on the beginning of August. The screenshots showed that the sound of the quiver will be fully encrypted from August 1st.<br>As the initiator of electronic face list, Alibaba led many express companies to establish a logistics service provider “rookie network” in 2013. In May of the next year, all express companies accepted the public electronic face list platform launched by rookie network.<br>Of course, Jingdong and pinduoduo have also launched their own electronic face lists in the follow-up. Therefore, this measure can be regarded as a standard configuration to protect users’ data privacy.<br>However, what deserves more attention is the capital layout of byte itself in the field of logistics.<br>On August 25, 2021, byte established two logistics companies, one named Shanghai Daoqu Yuedong Logistics Technology Co., Ltd. and the other is Shanghai Xingchen Yuedong Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. their business scope is related to goods warehousing services supervised by the customs.<br>In the first few days of the same month, byte invested in zongteng group, a global cross-border e-commerce infrastructure service provider, which mainly provides overseas warehousing and other services for cross-border e-commerce merchants.<br>In addition, it also invested in three logistics robot Enterprises: Jiazhi technology, future robot and syrius Juxing.<br>On the one hand, it is internal incubation, on the other hand, it is investment at the same time, which is similar to the logic of rookie’s asset layout - self support as a supplement, investment as the main, investment in major logistics enterprises, layout of warehouses, and mastering the big data of sales and logistics.<br>Rookie’s tiktok network is more likely to rely on the Internet mode of rookie if it takes into account the recent market crazy “tiktok” has completed the investment in the rabbit express, and the integrated voice service of the United States express company.<br>This seems to be in line with the mainstream thinking. For the tiktok electricity supplier, if it imitates Jingdong logistics, it is undoubtedly very difficult. Jingdong Logistics asset construction costs a lot. In order to implement the logistics construction idea of integrating Jingdong warehouse and equipment, the volume of Jingdong fixed assets and projects under construction is different from that of general logistics enterprises.<br>But Kwai Kwai Kwai logistics has been ahead of the tiktok, Zhang Yipeng, who was responsible for the sales center of the fast hand business in January 2021, told the twenty-first Century economic report that “no quick self service supply chain planning is built in the short term.”<br>On the whole, the voice business is trying to make up the logistics puzzle, which is a tiktok question.

          <p>The “darkest hour” of Ningde era seems not to be over.<br>As of the closing on February 21, the share price of Ningde times has fallen to 510 yuan, and the total market value has also fallen to 1.19 trillion yuan. Such a share price crisis has been staged many times on the trading day after the opening of the market after the Spring Festival in 2022.<br>From February 7 to February 11, the share price of Ningde times fell for four days. Especially on February 11, its share price even fell below the 500 yuan mark. As of the closing of the day, it finally fell 5.43% to 489.99 yuan, down nearly 30% from the historical high of 692 yuan set on December 3, 2021. So far, the share price of Ningde era fell by 17.34% in one week, and the market value of 239.2 billion yuan was evaporated.<br>Pessimism spread rapidly among investors. “The continuous decline in the share price of Ningde era has terrified investors, and bad comments are flying all over the sky, leading many investors to believe that Ningde era still has great room for decline.” A Ningde era investor recalled to the “bullet wealth view”.<br>In fact, it is not very common for a component manufacturer in the automotive industry chain to gain widespread attention. Ningde era mainly supplies power batteries and solutions for new energy vehicles, and does not directly face end consumers. Usually, it should play the role of “behind the scenes” without too high popularity.<br>However, Ningde era has attracted much attention for two reasons: on the one hand, after more than three years of listing, the total market value of Ningde era has fully doubled by 16 times, which is dubbed “ningmao”; On the other hand, power batteries account for 40% - 50% of the whole vehicle cost of new energy vehicles. Ningde era directly affects the vehicle delivery of various new energy vehicle manufacturers and the development direction of power batteries.<br>According to the “bullet wealth view”, there are various reasons for the continuous decline of share price in Ningde era, and the deep-seated reasons point to the loosening of the view of “hegemony theory in Ningde era” held by investors.<br>A common phenomenon is that in order to ensure the smooth supply chain, new energy vehicle manufacturers increasingly do not want to rely too much on a power battery manufacturer, which may change the dominant situation in Ningde era.<br>Some people in the new energy vehicle industry once told the “bullet financial view” that the purpose of new energy vehicle manufacturers to “escape” from the Ningde era is not non cooperation, but to reduce costs in the supply chain and grasp more dominant power, so as to prevent monopoly and supply interruption in the supply chain.<br>The above investors also expressed similar views. They believe that power battery manufacturers who rush to buy orders have emerged one after another, and technical barriers have been broken. Even new energy vehicle manufacturers have begun to build their own power battery supply chain. In the long run, the trend of Ningde era may not be clear.<br>In contrast, the crisis caused by some superficial reasons is easier to solve. On February 13, Ningde times issued a statement on a series of bad remarks, saying that recently, malicious rumors such as Ningde times being sanctioned by the United States, being excluded from the gem index and collapsing with Tesla have emerged on the network platform, causing misinterpretation and misunderstanding in the market. Now it has officially reported to the public security organ and will investigate the legal responsibility of the rumor mongers according to law.<br>The continued decline of the stock price was stopped by this statement - at the close of February 14, Ningde era’s stock price returned to the 500 yuan mark to 508 yuan. However, the haze has not yet dissipated. Since the opening of the market on February 7, its share price has fallen by 11.98% and its total market value has shrunk by about 180 billion yuan.<br>The rise and fall of share price is only an abstract performance, which is reflected in specific events. On the one hand, the price of raw materials for lithium batteries such as battery grade lithium carbonate in the upstream has gone up all the way, resulting in an obvious rise in the production cost of Ningde era; On the other hand, power battery manufacturers such as LG new energy and honeycomb energy are rising, eroding the market share of Ningde era and causing local threats to it.<br>Although Ningde era has been the world’s largest power battery manufacturer for five consecutive years, it seems not easy to return to its peak.</p>
<h3 id="01-Lithium-battery-raw-materials-continue-to-be-in-short-supply"><a href="#01-Lithium-battery-raw-materials-continue-to-be-in-short-supply" class="headerlink" title="01. Lithium battery raw materials continue to be in short supply"></a>01. Lithium battery raw materials continue to be in short supply</h3><p>In recent years, the soaring price of lithium battery raw materials can be called “Crazy”.<br>According to the data of Shanghai Nonferrous Metals network, as of February 17, battery grade lithium carbonate increased by 8000 to 430000 yuan &#x2F; ton; Battery grade coarse-grained lithium hydroxide increased by 8000 yuan to 364500 yuan &#x2F; ton; Lithium hexafluorophosphate increased by 10000 yuan to 560000 yuan &#x2F; ton.<br>The price of battery grade lithium carbonate increased by 48.3% compared with 290000 yuan &#x2F; ton at the beginning of 2022 and 681% compared with 55000 yuan &#x2F; ton at the beginning of 2021.<br>Raw material prices remained high, and power battery manufacturers quickly responded. The price increases of SDI and LG energy ranged from 5% to 5%.<br>Some people from Ningde times frankly said that the short-term rise in the cost of raw materials such as battery grade lithium carbonate did have a certain impact on profits. Li Ming, a new materials analyst, revealed to bullet Caiguan that although the price of battery grade lithium carbonate has increased by more than six times, it is far from reaching the high point. “The price of battery grade lithium carbonate will continue to rise steadily in the near future, which will also lead to the rising production cost of power battery manufacturers. It is generally predicted in the industry that the price of battery grade lithium carbonate is expected to rise to 500000 yuan &#x2F; ton.”<br>However, compared with the price rise, what makes power battery manufacturers crazy is that money can’t buy raw materials.<br>“There is a big gap in the supply of raw materials,” Guo Liang, a person in the new energy vehicle industry, analyzed the “bullet finance view.” it is mainly because the outbreak of new energy vehicle sales has exacerbated the shortage of raw materials, and as a raw material supplier, it has no way to expand in a short time. “<br>Li Ming predicted that the shortage of lithium battery raw materials will continue for about 1-2 years, and the global competition for lithium resources will further intensify.<br>A fact that can not be ignored is that the control of the upstream and downstream supply chain and the stable supply of upstream raw materials have become the key to the survival and development of power battery manufacturers.<br>Investment is the most important means to control the upstream and downstream industrial chain. In order to balance the cost pressure caused by the rise in the price of raw materials, Ningde times is investing and acquiring lithium mines everywhere to strengthen the stability of its raw material supply.<br>In July 2021, Ganfeng international, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ganfeng lithium, proposed to launch a tender offer for Millennium lithium, a Canadian lithium company, with a transaction amount of no more than C $353 million (about RMB 1.820 billion), but was later intercepted by Ningde times at a price of C $378.6 million (about RMB 1.887 billion).<br>A major reason behind Ningde times and Ganfeng lithium competing to acquire Millennium lithium is that Millennium lithium has two Argentine Salt Lake projects that mainly produce battery grade lithium carbonate and lithium compounds.<br>Then, Tianhua times, a shareholder of Ningde times, invested US $240 million (about RMB 1.552 billion) in Manono lithium mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is reported that Manono lithium deposit is one of the hard rock lithium deposits with the largest reserves and the highest grade that have been found at present. The proved resource volume has reached 269 million tons and the estimated lithium resource reserve has reached 400 million tons.<br>Ningde era has also accelerated the layout of industrial chain in China. Specifically, Sichuan times new energy, a subsidiary of Ningde times, signed a joint venture agreement with Ganzi investment group, Yibin Sanjiang Huida company and Sichuan Tianfu Mining Company to increase the supply of lithium resources; In order to further accelerate the construction of lithium iron phosphate project in Shehong, Sichuan, Ningde times also signed a supplementary agreement and increased capital with Fulin Seiko and its subsidiaries.<br>In addition, Yongxing materials and its wholly-owned subsidiary Jiangxi Yongxing special steel new energy announced that it plans to establish a joint venture with Ningde times to build a project with an annual output of 20000 tons of lithium carbonate, and the output of lithium carbonate will be preferentially supplied to Ningde times.<br>It is worth mentioning that Ningde times has also jointly established 15 power battery manufacturing companies with more than 10 new energy vehicle manufacturers such as BAIC new energy and SAIC. According to incomplete statistics, more than 80% of the investment projects in Ningde era are closely related to the upstream and downstream industrial chain.<br>The advantages of binding upstream and downstream industrial chains are also very obvious. Hua’an Securities pointed out in the research report that Ningde times can get raw materials at a lower price, such as ternary cathode, which accounts for the highest proportion in the production cost of power battery, and Ningde times enjoys a discount of more than 10%.</p>
<h3 id="02-Competitors-catch-up"><a href="#02-Competitors-catch-up" class="headerlink" title="02. Competitors catch up"></a>02. Competitors catch up</h3><p>The knot of the shortage of lithium battery raw materials has not been solved, but the challengers who openly challenge the Ningde era have emerged.<br>On January 27, LG new energy, the second largest power battery manufacturer in the world and the largest power battery manufacturer in Korea, was officially listed on the Korean stock exchange. The listing of LG new energy completely ignited the enthusiasm of Korean investors. As of the close of the day, the share price of LG new energy soared 68%, with a total market value of 624 billion yuan, becoming the second highest enterprise in South Korea after Samsung Electronics.<br>In the field of lithium-ion batteries, LG new energy is a true pioneer. After 27 years of development, except in South Korea, LG new energy’s business scope almost covers the European and American markets. However, for a long time, LG new energy has been suppressed by Ningde era. Until it got a huge order from Tesla’s Shanghai factory in 2020, the momentum gradually became fierce.<br>According to the statistics of SNE research, a Korean market research institution, in 2021, the global power battery loading volume of Ningde era was 96.7gwh, with a year-on-year increase of 167.5%. The global market share increased from 24.6% in 2020 to 32.6%, while LG new energy ranked second with a global market share of 20.3%.<br>Tesla and Geely are the main customers of LG new energy in the Chinese market, but even so, LG new energy’s performance in the Chinese market is still difficult to be optimistic.<br>According to the statistics of China automotive power battery industry innovation alliance, in 2021, the top five power battery enterprises in China were Ningde times, BYD, China Innovation airlines, GuoXuan high tech and LG new energy, with market share of 52.1%, 16.2%, 5.9%, 5.2% and 4% respectively.<br>Although the total market value and market share are inferior to that of Ningde era, LG new energy has no small ambition. Earlier, Quan yingshou, CEO of LG new energy, said bluntly at the South Korean media exchange meeting, “considering that more battery orders have been received, LG new energy’s global market share is expected to exceed Ningde era and become the first in the world.”<br>Sun Guang, a practitioner in the power battery industry, disagreed with this. He told the “bullet financial view” that “if we do not improve the market share in the Chinese market, LG new energy will surpass Ningde era in the global market in the distant future.”<br>Subsequently, he added: “LG new energy’s business includes energy storage battery business, power battery business and consumer battery business, while Ningde era does not involve consumer battery business. In terms of business performance, the two sides are equal. In fact, there is still a big gap between LG new energy and Ningde era.”<br>However, LG new energy can not be underestimated. In the first three quarters of 2021, the gross profit margin of LG new energy was 24.25%, which was only 3.26% lower than that of Ningde era. It is noteworthy that the gross profit margin of the former was growing, while that of the latter showed a slight downward trend.<br>In the Chinese market, the defense of Ningde era is not solid. In addition to LG new energy, honeycomb energy also has the strength to challenge the Ningde era. On January 13, 2022, honeycomb energy conducted listing guidance and filing in Jiangsu securities regulatory bureau, and plans to log on to the science and innovation board.<br>The predecessor of honeycomb energy is the power battery division of Great Wall Motors, which began to operate independently in 2018. Although the volume of honeycomb energy is small, it has been developing by leaps and bounds. According to the statistical data of SNE research, the loading volume of honeycomb energy increased by 430% year-on-year in 2021, ranking 10th with a 1% global market share.<br>In December 2021, Yang Hongxin, chairman and CEO of honeycomb energy, revealed at the second battery day of honeycomb energy that as of December, honeycomb energy had signed more than 30 fixed-point projects, including Great Wall, Dongfeng, FAW, Geely, Hezhong new energy, Thalis and Zero run.<br>The capital pool of honeycomb energy is also quite abundant. So far, honeycomb energy has successively completed five rounds of financing, with a cumulative financing amount of tens of billions of yuan and a valuation of 46 billion yuan.<br>In addition to the above two strong rivals, BYD is also one of the strongest competitors in Ningde era. In 2021, BYD’s loading capacity was 3.39 GWH, accounting for 20.93% of the Chinese market.<br>However, at present, the blade batteries produced by BYD are almost used by its own models, which means that the loading volume of BYD alone, a new energy vehicle manufacturer, accounts for more than 20% of the Chinese market. At present, blade batteries are also favored by many new energy vehicle manufacturers, such as Tesla, velai and Volkswagen Group.<br>Sun Guang told “bullet financial view” that there are two key points in the competition among power battery manufacturers at present, one is the production capacity, and the other is the revolutionary technology. The current market pattern will not change greatly until both have not changed.<br>However, some small changes are taking place. In addition to LG new energy, beehive energy and BYD, power battery manufacturers such as China Innovation airlines, xinwanda and GuoXuan high tech have gradually entered the supply chain system of some leading new energy vehicle manufacturers, forming a siege against the Ningde era.</p>
<h3 id="03-Ningde-era-opens-up-a-new-battlefield"><a href="#03-Ningde-era-opens-up-a-new-battlefield" class="headerlink" title="03. Ningde era opens up a new battlefield"></a>03. Ningde era opens up a new battlefield</h3><p>Surprisingly, while struggling on the power battery battlefield, Ningde era has freed up its hands to open up a new battlefield.<br>On January 18, times electric service, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ningde times, launched the power exchange service brand evogo (Le hang power exchange) and the overall power exchange solution composed of three products: “power exchange block, quick exchange station and app”:<br>“Chocolate power exchange block” is a modular battery specially developed for power exchange mode. A single block can provide a endurance of about 200 kilometers, and is suitable for 80% of the models developed by pure electric platforms that have been listed in the world and will be listed in the next three years;<br>The quick change station can adapt to all models using “chocolate power change blocks”. At the same time, 48 power change blocks can be stored in the station, which can realize automatic power change, and the power change time is about 1 minute;<br>App is a supporting program specially designed for power exchange, which provides the interconnection and service of people, vehicles, stations and power blocks.<br>On February 14, at the meeting for specific objects held by Ningde times, its management explained the reasons for entering the power exchange market, “It is difficult to replace the models in the price range of 80000-120000 by electrification. The first purchase cost of new energy vehicles (excluding batteries) can be lower than that of fuel vehicles, and the replacement speed is equal to that of fuel vehicles, so as to solve the problem of cost performance.”<br>However, the significance of entering the power exchange market is more than that.<br>“The layout of power exchange business in Ningde times can help it cope with the business bottleneck period in advance and complete the commercial closed loop of ‘mining - R &amp; D and manufacturing - supply - recycling’, which is essentially to solve the anxiety about the supply of raw materials for upstream lithium batteries.” Li Ming analyzed the “bullet financial view” and said, “if the upstream raw material supply is impacted due to some uncontrollable factors, the power exchange business can play a complementary and alternative role.”<br>At the same time, the power exchange market is still a huge market with a scale of 100 billion. Orient Securities pointed out in the research report that in 2025, the number of replacement trams in China is expected to reach 5 million, about 22000 replacement power stations will be put into operation, and the scale of the operating market is expected to touch 263.1 billion yuan.<br>From the significance and market space of power exchange business, although the road of power exchange in Ningde era has bright prospects, there are still many difficulties in implementing it.<br>“The production standards and size specifications of power batteries mainly depend on power battery manufacturers and new energy vehicle manufacturers. The current market share in Ningde era is still difficult to reach the height of industry standard setters, which means that it is still unknown how many manufacturers are willing to try and adopt.” People in the industry said.<br>Another fact we have to face up to is that the power exchange business is still difficult to make a profit.<br>For example, the total revenue of Aodong new energy, a new energy vehicle power exchange service provider, in 2018-2020 was 82 million yuan, 212 million yuan and 190 million yuan respectively, while the net profit was - 186 million yuan, - 162 million yuan and - 249 million yuan respectively. Aodong new energy has not only been in the mire of loss, but also its loss continues to expand.<br>However, there is a more optimistic view that with the accession of Ningde era and the introduction of policies to further clarify the standards related to the construction of replacement power stations, the problem of industry standards is expected to be solved faster.<br>In fact, the power exchange business is not enough to fill the ambition of Ningde era.<br>In the latest record of investor relations activities released by Ningde times, an investor asked: “China Kehai sodium has cooperated with Three Gorges energy. Does the company cooperate with sodium innovative energy? How is the layout of the industrial chain?”<br>In this regard, the Secretary of Ningde times replied: “at present, the company has started the industrialization layout of sodium ion batteries, and a basic industrial chain will be formed in 2023.”<br>The price of raw materials for upstream lithium batteries is rising. In addition to laying out the power exchange business, Ningde era has also launched a plan to find alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.<br>In July 2021, Ningde times officially released the first generation of sodium ion battery. The energy density of the single cell of the sodium ion battery has reached 160wh &#x2F; kg, which is the highest level in the world. After charging for 15 minutes at room temperature, the power can reach 80%. Even in the low temperature environment of - 20 ℃, it still has a discharge retention rate of more than 90%.<br>However, compared with lithium-ion batteries with an energy density of 300wh &#x2F; kg, sodium ion batteries are slightly inferior, but one advantage of the latter that cannot be ignored is that its raw material price has a huge advantage over the former - the raw material price of sodium ion batteries is about 4000-5000 yuan &#x2F; ton.<br>In addition, the working principle of sodium ion battery is very similar to that of lithium ion battery. Its manufacturing equipment is also fully compatible with lithium ion battery, and the conversion cost is low.<br>Solid state batteries are also a major technological trend. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, although solid-state batteries are also inseparable from lithium, there is almost no consumption of lithium ions in the process of charging and discharging, which can keep the capacity of solid-state batteries stable for a long time and greatly improve the cycle life.<br>There is a view that the solid-state battery will become the ultimate form of the power battery of new energy vehicles. At the same time, it is also an important watershed and technical commanding point in the power battery industry. “The day when the solid-state battery is popularized is the time when the fuel vehicles withdraw from the historical stage”.<br>Before the emergence of revolutionary technology, it has become the consensus of power battery manufacturers to stabilize the basic plate of power battery business by expanding production capacity and constantly explore new battlefields.<br>“The leading position of Ningde era is not so easy to be shaken, but it is uncertain that a battery technology revolution will break out one day. In order to hold the position of the first brother of power battery, Ningde era can only run desperately.” The industry said.<br>*Li Ming, Guo Liang and sun Guang are pseudonyms.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:zidancaiguan.

<li>China’s music therapy industry is getting more attention, which is related to the social background of about 54 million people suffering from depression and about 41 million people suffering from anxiety disorder.</li>
<li>The music healing industry has diversified manifestations. Not only is the offline Songbo music hot, but also platforms such as Himalaya and cool dog have entered the market. At the same time, there are also a large number of music content creators.</li>
<li>Behind the music therapy industry is the basic logic of music therapy, which has gone from theory to the public.</li>
<li>To become a music therapist, there must be professional and professional regulations, but beyond this specific concept, everyone can apply music to life for self adjustment.<br>“What do you like about this song?” Gao Tian asked the visitor.<br>“I don’t know English, so I don’t know what to sing inside, but I think it sounds good. I think this song is very kind and kind.”<br>When Gao Tian asked about the relationship between the visitor and his father, the visitor was stunned at first. He didn’t speak for a long time, and then his tears came down. The visitor said, “in my memory, I don’t remember that my father once held himself and never got fatherly love.”<br>This is an ordinary music therapy scene. Gao Tian, the founder of the domestic music therapy discipline, told the little antler music finance. “In music therapy, it is said that a person likes a song or a piece of music for no reason. It is purely pleasant to hear. It must have something to do with his own unique life experience or the needs of the emotional world.”<br>The healing function of music is a new way of punk health preservation for a generation, which is related to the current general state of the public.<br>According to the sample survey of residents in 16 cities with a population of more than one million conducted by China Health Association in 2021, the proportion of sub-health in China has reached more than 70%, and the population in sub-health status has reached about 700 million, showing an upward trend. According to who statistics, about 54 million people in China suffer from depression and about 41 million people suffer from anxiety disorders.<br>Meanwhile, according to the survey data of China Sleep Research Association, the incidence of insomnia in Chinese adults is 38.2%, and nearly 300 million people may need sleep services such as sound therapy.<br>The 2021 white paper on Chinese scene music users released by airy consulting reveals that the principle of music therapy is actually the basic logic behind healing music.<br>So how does music therapy develop? Will music therapy guided by it be the next outlet?<h3 id="Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines"><a href="#Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines" class="headerlink" title="Music therapy based on professional disciplines"></a>Music therapy based on professional disciplines</h3>Although the first Chinese medical book, Huangdi Neijing, discusses in detail the relationship between people’s heart, liver, spleen, lung and stomach and the five tone palace Shang Jiao Yu, and puts forward the theory that “there are five internal organs to respond to the five tones”, “happy and sad, angry hurt the liver, excellent hurt the lung, think about hurting the swelling and fear hurting the arm. Therefore, the musician moves the blood circulation, spirit and right heart”, But music therapy officially became a professional discipline at the University of Casas in 1940.<br>After more than half a century of development, the scope of work of music therapists has covered many fields, such as psychology, rehabilitation, anesthesia, childbirth, hospice care, cancer rehabilitation, hospital living environment, pain control, physical and mental disease maintenance and so on.<br>In 1988, China Conservatory of music established a junior college class of music therapy, taught by Zhang Hongyi. Although due to teachers and other reasons, this major will be closed soon. But this master class opened the way for the professional development of music therapy. In 1997, under the leadership of Gao Tian, the Central Conservatory of music systematically introduced the discipline of music therapy and established the research center of music therapy. Then, the professional education of music therapy in China rose one after another.<br>However, in terms of public cognition and acceptance, music therapy is still “minority”, and this major first came into public view after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008.<br>At that time, Gao Tian led a team to the disaster area to carry out music therapy activities. In November of the same year, Gao Tian was invited to attend the annual meeting of American music therapy and delivered a speech on “music therapy crisis intervention in China’s Sichuan earthquake”, which caused a sensation in the American music therapy industry. This speech also enabled the practice of Chinese music therapy to gradually step onto the international stage.<br>In addition to discipline construction, social vocational education of music therapists is also in full bloom. Gaotian music mental health research center, China Commercial Enterprise Association, music medicine and technical equipment branch of China Medical Equipment Association and other social organizations have provided certification training courses for music therapists, and “hindmet” practical music (Chengdu hindmet Culture Communication Co., Ltd.) has also provided brand certification training for gebmusik music therapists.<br>In 2014, after many efforts, China business enterprise management association approved the establishment of the music therapist Industry Committee of China business enterprise management association. Gao Tian, Zhao Xin, Liu Mingming, Wang Bing, Liu Lichun, Zhou Ping, Wang Lujie, Zhang Xiaoying and a group of practitioners from various universities, 100 million yuan and rehabilitation centers formed a supervisor group.<br>What develops in the same way as education is practice. However, in terms of the chronological development order of music therapy in China, music physiotherapy precedes music therapy. In the late 1970s, electroacupuncture was used in some hospitals, including music therapy and electrotherapy. Later, there were successively music light frequency therapy, music guidance (Music qigong) and other treatment methods.<br>In September 1984, Mawangdui sanatorium established the first psychomusic treatment room in China. From 1985 to 1986, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital and Beijing Anding Hospital cooperated with music professionals to carry out scientific research on active music therapy for senile depression and operational music therapy for chronic schizophrenia.<br>In 1991, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital established a music treatment room in the behavior treatment area, which is also the first hospital to establish a music treatment room in the national psychiatric hospital, and created a new treatment model for the rehabilitation of mental patients.<br>During the municipal government covid-19, COVID-19 and the provincial and municipal governments attached great importance to the psychological assistance of new crowns infected with pneumonia, close contacts, front-line workers and difficult people. They issued a number of psychological aid policies and measures, and asked for continuous psychological counseling, emotional support and psychological crisis intervention.<br>Beijing Huilongguan Hospital has set up a psychological rescue medical team to provide targeted and effective psychological decompression and relaxation methods for front-line medical staff in the fight against the epidemic, including music therapy. In addition, various institutions, colleges and individual music therapists in the field of music therapy have responded to the call and contributed to the cause of psychological assistance.<br>For example, Professor Wan Ying, a professor at Wuhan Conservatory of Music, led the team to start the music therapy radio, and sent two music decompression and relaxation music packages to the public through the WeChat official account. Zhang Ren, a distinguished expert from the research center of personality and social psychology of Peking University, dredged the panic psychology of the people in the form of online micro courses, and gave guidance to the medical staff in the epidemic area on music therapy technology.<br>Gao Tian, who has retired from the Central Conservatory of music, has established a “music therapy online psychological assistance hotline platform”, which solves the obstacles of face-to-face consultation technology caused by the epidemic through remote means such as ear worms, mer trauma treatment technology and music safety island, so as to carry out psychological intervention. Wen Yun and Shi Jingjie in Guangzhou jointly launched the “home music self-care action” with other music therapists, using music to provide emotional regulation and relief for residents in the sealed area.<br>Strictly speaking, home music self-care cannot be regarded as the category of music therapy.<br>In October 2021, Gao Tian also mentioned in the academic lecture “Reflection on the development of music therapy in China and Thinking on Postmodern music psychotherapy” that the boundary between music therapy and “music entertainment” is vague, which can not reflect the uniqueness, professionalism and technicality of music therapy. Therapists must prove the medical and social value of this profession in the clinical process in order to make the public recognize music therapy as a systematic science.<br>However, music therapist Wen Yun said that music self-care is a set of public oriented methods based on “music guided imagination” in music therapy, which can spread the concept of music therapy to more people.<br>In order to make the public better understand the significance of music therapy, Zhang Ren, who has long been engaged in music therapy and clinical psychological research in the field of adolescent emotional intervention and marginal criminal behavior intervention, wrote the musical psychological drama addictive people. Different from the previous dramas promoting drug addiction and Internet addiction, the play does not blindly emphasize the serious harm of these addictions, but discusses the environmental and psychological factors of the formation of these addictions.<br>In November 2021, the third annual academic conference of the World League music therapy Specialized Committee was held in Shanghai. The topics of music therapy and music therapy, the quality standard for training professionals in music therapy, and the construction of first-rate professional were discussed in the era of music therapy and Chinese medicine, COVID-19 and post epidemic Era.<br>With the development of music therapy, the healing music industry came into being.<h3 id="Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period"><a href="#Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period" class="headerlink" title="Music healing industry in the exploratory period"></a>Music healing industry in the exploratory period</h3>According to the public data of Himalaya, in 2020, more than 83 million people listened to healing music in Himalaya, and the average consumption amount of music paying users reached 76 yuan. From 2018 to 2020, the number of healing music listeners increased by 302%.<br>By 2021, according to the white paper on Chinese scene music users in 2021 released by iResearch, the vast majority of users of healing scenes prefer soothing and decompressing music, accounting for 83.7%, and the user stickiness is high. The cumulative proportion of listening to healing scene music once a day or more is as high as 57.5%. In addition, in terms of the single listening time of users, users in the healing scene will listen for 1 to 2 hours at a time. In addition, many users will listen for more than 3 hours at a time.<br>In terms of willingness to pay, more users are willing to pay for soothing and decompressing music and lonely healing music. The cumulative willingness to pay for these two music forms is 82.4% and 80.7% respectively, of which users aged 26 to 30 have the highest willingness to pay. Among the types of soothing and decompressing music, users aged 31 to 35 and 41 to 45 also pay a relatively high proportion, reaching 56.1% and 50% respectively.<br>In 2021, kugou cooperated with the ear circle to launch “delta brain wave 3D immersive sleep aid music”, and worked with the medical team and psychological institutions to create a “healing zone”, including the music for the scene of pregnancy and childbirth based on the social environment with a probability of depression of up to 43%.<br>As a team focusing on situational auditory content production and technology research and development, ear circle is also the top blogger of healing music in the Himalayas. According to the ear team, the production of healing music must be based on early experiments, which is also the most important part.<br>Music healing is ultimately to act on people, with certain functionality, not just the appreciation of pure music, so it must have a basis. Based on the research of experiments and papers, discuss with musicians and sound excellence, and then use some more advanced audio production technologies, and add professional contents such as psychology and cognitive behavior therapy to ensure that the album is professional and effective, and at the same time, it also conforms to the aesthetics of Chinese people in music.<br>In addition to the ears, with the vigorous development of scene music, there are also a large number of scene music content creators in the market. Based on the market demand, kugou launched an open platform for self-service distribution of scene music and video content; After the content is released, the cool dog traffic bonus will be shared to realize diversified realization. It is understood that the open platform has gathered more than 10000 creators of various contents.<br>In addition to the online market, the exploration of music therapy online and offline has existed long ago, and the current expression methods are becoming more and more diversified.<br>The heart rhyme healing Academy established by Wang Yuan in 2006 is the leader in the sound Bowl Healing industry. At present, it has trained more than 6000 healers. The sound bowl training camp of heart rhyme therapy lasts for 12 days. The first 7 days are first-order and second-order techniques and case study; The next 5 days are marketing training. Compared with Songbo, Yinbo is more committed to cultivating excellent Yinbo healers. On December 15, 2021, the first five senses healing education and training demonstration base in China officially landed at Xinyun Beijing headquarters.<br>During the Spring Festival, due to the popularity of short-term training, Shanghai Songbo Yinbo physical and mental therapist training class is also called to start the human body’s self-healing ability through listening and physical contact, so as to help the human body restore a balanced and harmonious state of health. Fees range from 1180 yuan for the primary level to 3980 yuan for the advanced level, and the service of examining the certificate of sound therapy tutor is also provided.<br>Although there are different views on whether the effect of sound therapy can meet the expectations on the Internet, Shanghai nianqian Culture Communication Co., Ltd., established in 2018, is sought after by a group of fans for its sub-health status and career development anxiety of contemporary people.<br>The ear circle also mentioned with fawn horn music finance that some hotels will ask them to customize some albums in order to provide soothing sleep supporting music or vocals when guests sleep. The monthly club will also customize some music to help mothers alleviate anxiety and depression.<br>With the development of science and technology, AI technology has also brought new development to the music therapy industry. The ear circle mentioned that the healing music has been shaped into a three-dimensional auditory scene through some 3D engine technology and the production of virtual reality content. In the future, it may involve some means of using artificial intelligence algorithms to generate music.<br>Muru music health, founded abroad in 2020, claims to be the first music streaming media platform for people over the age of 60. It creates a personalized music experience through AI according to users’ hobbies and interests, and uses AI technology to resist the impact of brain aging. At present, the software charges its members a $67.90 (about $50) every six months, and has established an exclusive music partnership with Universal Music Australia to obtain a larger music library and cooperate with Google cloud to technically start faster and smarter work.<br>Hebei Caiwen Technology Co., Ltd. in China is a high-tech company focusing on EEG research, low-frequency sound wave pulse application and EMT EEG music therapy. Its frequency music medical team has launched frequency music headphones through the combination of low-frequency sound wave pulse technology and music therapy.<br>Referring to the current development status of the industry, the ear team said that from the experience of these two or three years, the industry is still in its infancy. The logic of the whole industry is not very clear, including the source of income and how to realize it. However, from the user feedback, there are particularly many people with sleep problems and psychological problems. Chen Fuguo, a teacher from the ear group, once said that at present, almost one-third to one-quarter of people in clinical practice have sleep problems. In addition, patients with anxiety, depression and fear also account for the majority of patients. From this perspective, music therapy still has development prospects.<br>In addition, although the overall industry is not particularly large, we have begun to pay attention to it slowly. From the amount of broadcasting in the ear, the epidemic has also prompted people to pay more attention to sleep and mental health.<br>But at the same time, some chaos also accompanied.<br>In 2020, a kind of music called “subliminal” became popular in station B. up owners claim that this kind of music can not only listen more and more beautiful, comparable to painless cosmetic surgery, but also improve financial status, eliminate viruses and private customized wishes. For a time, the number of hits of various videos has soared. At present, the number of hits of “true! High nose bridge &#x2F; nose base dry goods, sharing at the bottom of up” has exceeded 400000. However, at the top of the video, station B has marked the words “this content is for entertainment only, please don’t believe it”.<br>This kind of “song + positive guide + several good-looking photos” is a combination. Subliminal has existed on YouTube for several years, but there has been constant negative news. Blogger sapien medicine even added a sales link directly below his subliminal video. The price ranged from $22 or $3 to $136, which was called fraud by many netizens.<br>Another blogger, mind power, was accused of hiding some dark subconscious ideas in the video, which plunged the audience into nightmares and greatly affected their mental state. Some people were even sent to the emergency room. However, these symptoms gradually disappeared within a few weeks after she stopped using it. Although mind power’s account was closed, the debate continued. Rose subliminals, another blogger, publicly admitted that she had added negative hints to the video. After that, she chose to quit the subconscious community and close her YouTube account.<br>Some netizens attribute it to music therapy. So, does this belong to the category of music therapy? We consulted Gao Tian, whose master’s thesis is about the study of subliminal music. Gao Tian said that from an academic point of view, no matter looking through previous papers or through his own experiments, no significant difference was found, so this method can not be said to be useful or useless.<br>However, in the business world, no matter whether it is useful or not, as long as they see the business opportunities, some people boast that this thing is magical, “even if someone wants to cooperate with themselves, I refuse. I say you can do research on science, but push it to the market without the support of solid experimental data. I think this is a kind of deception”.<br>Gao Tian also cited an example. When he first returned to China in 1997, some people sold this at a high price. At that time, an ordinary music CD was about seven or eight yuan, but this kind of CD sold for 2800 yuan. It was falsely said that it was the high technology and subconscious of the United States. In addition, success learning was very popular at that time. Some people thought that after the subconscious input, they could succeed, Can make a fortune, so I don’t care about the 2800 yuan.<br>However, for the chaos of industry development, discipline leaders have been trying to lead the public out of misunderstanding.<br>Liu Mingming, director of the music therapy center of the Central Conservatory of music, once pointed out that music therapy is not a music prescription for symptomatic listening to music. Music is directly related to everyone’s growth background, social environment and cultural environment. Everyone has different feelings about the same music work. So we can’t say which music solves what problem like prescribing.<br>But at the same time, music has something in common. For example, medium speed and slow music with soft melody can make people relax, but it’s like asking the doctor what kind of diet is conducive to health. The doctor will give you a balanced diet, eat more vegetables and fruits and eat less greasy. It’s the most basic principle and doesn’t involve targeted treatment suggestions.<br>Liu Mingming also stressed that music therapy is not a simple collage of “music + psychology + medicine”, and in addition to theoretical learning, it is also a highly practical discipline. Therefore, music therapists need comprehensive professional training. They can’t become music therapists by participating in short-term training. About the professional training of music therapists The issue of industry access standards for qualification certification needs to be discussed.<br>But at the same time, in addition to the professional concept of music therapist, music belongs to all mankind. Everyone has the right, ability and conditions to use music to enrich and beautify their own life, and apply music to life for self adjustment, which everyone can do.<br>Generally speaking, in terms of discipline, the goal of music therapy major in Colleges and universities is to cultivate music therapy professionals who meet the needs of society.<br>Cui Yiyun, a new generation practitioner of music therapy who graduated from the Central Conservatory of music, once said that music therapy is relatively mature in Beijing. There are professional music therapy in the Autism Center of Bo’ai hospital and the psychology department of Beijing Anding Hospital. However, in more and more cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Foshan, Wuxi, Hangzhou and Qinhuangdao, Music therapy has begun to appear.<br>In the market, there are various music therapy institutions, clinics and apps, and the industry is still sporadic and scattered. However, the exploration and attempt of the healing industry has played a positive role in the professionalization and professionalization of domestic music therapy.<br>China’s music therapy still has a long way to go, but the anxiety of the general environment makes people more and more dependent on the healing effect of music. The entry of cool dog has taken the first step. In the art examination that kicked off in the new year, another batch of fresh blood has joined the industry.<br>Will there be new entrants to the music healing market in 2022?<br>This article is from WeChat public No. ID:musicbusiness, the official account of krypton, 36 krypton.</li>

          <p>In the era of fragmented attention economy, more and more people are used to browsing the grass planting notes written by others on the Internet before placing an order, so as to understand the useful information about the use feeling, quality parameters, functional characteristics, price range, precautions and so on.<br>For individual consumers, this can not only avoid detours, but also compare goods in terms of price, and the form of grass planting has developed from the initial good thing sharing and use experience to various forms such as live delivery, online popular exploration stores and professional evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="01-content-grass-planting-has-become-one-of-the-important-ways-of-commercial-brand-marketing"><a href="#01-content-grass-planting-has-become-one-of-the-important-ways-of-commercial-brand-marketing" class="headerlink" title="01 content grass planting has become one of the important ways of commercial brand marketing"></a>01 content grass planting has become one of the important ways of commercial brand marketing</h3><p>Now the content operation has become a common practice, and the grass planting economy has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Crow Rui released the Research Report on the grass planting power of three platforms in 2020. Its content shows that nearly 80% of respondents said they had been planted by KOL, and nearly 70% of users believe that the grass planting content has a great impact on their final purchase behavior. At the end of last year, The survey results of the joint questionnaire network of the social survey center of China Youth Daily also show that more than 80% of the respondents will go online to search for relevant grass planting recommendations before shopping.<br>Cui Qian is a post-90s white-collar worker. Before buying large or expensive goods, she is used to searching online grass sharing, product recommendation, evaluation and comparison to see how others use their experience, and then choose products in combination with her own economic strength. If she can’t make up her mind at the moment, she will find some professional analysis of experts for reference.<br>Cui Qian is usually busy with her work, and her personal energy is really limited. In addition, there are many kinds of goods, and she doesn’t have time to choose from them one by one. Therefore, it can save a lot of time to buy goods directly by browsing the content of planting grass. Of course, in order to avoid stepping on the pit, Cui Qian suggests that it’s best to look at the consumption evaluation of different websites or creators, In particular, focus on negative comments.<br>In recent years, many social platforms, Internet e-commerce and content operation enterprises have focused on the track of grass growing economy and made efforts to layout one after another. Zhihu started the recruitment plan of MCN creators in 2019. Since its listing at the beginning of last year, Zhihu began to accelerate the pace of commercial construction and operation promotion of platform content, and first released the “cheese platform”, The function of the platform is to build a bridge for content cooperation and traffic transformation for creators and brand customers.<br>At the end of last year, Zhihu held the first ecological Partner Conference and released a number of plans.

For example, Zhihu’s good thing recommendation function can support the jump to e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, jd.com, pinduoduo and so on, To achieve accurate docking with brands or businesses, commercial content marketing has become one of the main positions of knowing revenue, accounting for about one-third of its total revenue.<br>B tiktok and shaking platform have similar functions, which can link the creators and brand customers to realize the content operation and commercial promotion. At present, many head enterprises or platforms have already been quite popular in content sharing and flow planting, but these enterprises are still facing different degrees of difficulty in sharing grass and straw contents and drainage and business transformation. Kwai tiktok and Taobao do or think the same without prior consulation2. Since last year, the content and operation platform of live broadcasting providers and other vendors have been speeding up the pace of deepening and improving the layout of the platform.<br>After the popularity and content cultural creation atmosphere are cultivated, all platforms are also trying to create an ecological and trading chain suitable for the development of brands and businesses. The ultimate goal is to build an ecological closed loop from content sharing to commercial operation. At the same time, we can also predict that the competition of all platforms in this field will only become increasingly fierce in the future.</p>

Therefore, the protagonist of content grass planting is also changing from graphics to video. Many content platforms are also actively encouraging and supporting the creation of MCN. Publishers can get more traffic support in this regard. At the same time, from the current traffic transformation situation, Live e-commerce may become the next breakthrough in the transformation of content platform to commercialization.<br>According to the data of Dongxing securities, the market scale of domestic live broadcasting e-commerce reached 2 trillion yuan last year. Compared with other content operation and traffic conversion methods, live broadcasting e-commerce has the advantages of strong intuition and interaction.

Live broadcasting can more conveniently help operators establish a value closed loop integrating content grass planting and commercial operation, So as to achieve the goal of rapid and efficient transformation relying on high-quality user groups.<br>AI Kwai consulting tiktok reported that the total merchandise transaction volume of Taobao live broadcast sector in 2020 (GMV) was about 400000000000 yuan, and the shaking sound was about 500000000000 Yuan, and the fast business electricity business sector was close to 400 billion yuan, which way ahead of the live broadcast business of other platforms.<br>Tiktok tiktok tiktok tiktok has increased the content of grass and passenger group transformation to a more important strategic level.

Whether it is the traditional goods of large and small e-commerce or the new consumer brands rising with the tide of the country, such as Yuanqi forest, perfect diary, bubble Mart, huaxizi, etc., all rely on the mode of content grass planting to a great extent, It has won the attention of the market and consumer groups, thus laying a good foundation for further growth and development.<br>For major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms, it is not difficult to establish a content creation and sharing mechanism including graphics, video, live broadcast, etc. the biggest difficulty lies in how to stabilize the traffic within the platform, rather than sharing the content on the platform as before, and finally users go to other e-commerce platforms, wechat The embarrassing situation of purchase and transaction of commercial and social media such as community.<br>Second, platform enterprises need to establish a perfect and attractive product or service system, which should include e-commerce supply service chain including commodity supply, merchant entry, payment and settlement, warehousing and logistics and other elements. Only in this way can we realize full flow transformation, Enterprises or e-commerce platforms can also obtain sufficient value returns from commercial operations in various ways.<br>From the current situation, the traffic conversion business still has a lot of room for improvement in the future development of major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms. Among them, deep cultivation of content operation and encouraging creators and brands to continuously supply high-quality original content are the basis for commodity sharing and traffic conversion. Efficient and convenient marketing and commercial cash realization methods are the key to improve the purchase conversion rate and repurchase rate of user groups. These two aspects are complementary and mutually reinforcing, In the future, it will become the primary goal of major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms.<br>For example, in recent years, content operation and traffic transformation have also become an important development direction of Taobao platform. Taobao has built a marketing matrix including Taobao live broadcast, Taobao headlines, Youku, good goods, etc. through internal introduction, outreach and maneuvering. Taobao shopping launched the year before last also integrates the content creation functions of individuals, businesses and brands. It can combine the content with graphics, video Live broadcast and other forms are presented to users from multiple angles.<br>Although there is still a certain gap between Taobao and expectations in terms of content diversity, professionalism and user stickiness, based on the huge user flow and transaction volume of Taobao system matrix and its convenient closed-loop advantages from content operation to transaction conversion, it is not difficult for us to predict that Taobao will have a promising future in this field.</p>
<h3 id="04-conclusion"><a href="#04-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="04 conclusion"></a>04 conclusion</h3><p>“Yu Jian column” believes that the traffic dividend in the Internet era is gradually fading, and the endless e-commerce platforms and commercial entrances make the Internet economy fragmented and decentralized. In the past, the way of accumulating popularity through content operation, developing brand advertising business and building business private traffic is gradually entering the bottleneck.<br>Both the content operation platform and Internet e-commerce are building a closed-loop system from content to transaction, and strive to form an efficient commercial transformation link including graphics, short video and live broadcast. When the platform operator establishes an efficient link from content creation to commercial operation, In the era of attention economy, enterprises can seize the first opportunity and take the lead in striving for user resources.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:yujianzhuanlan, and is published by Yu Bin, 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>At the beginning of 2022, the new energy vehicle making force continues to make rapid progress, and the traditional automobile brands are still exploring in the transformation. However, market sales seem to prove that the market seems to have little time left for traditional brand exploration.<br>On February 14, Great Wall Motors (2333. HK) released the sales announcement in January. The data showed that the sales volume in January 2022 totaled 111800 vehicles, a year-on-year decrease of 19.59%. The next day, Great Wall Motor’s share price jumped 4.75% to HK $18.44, the lowest since May 2021.<br>Generally speaking, compared with the decline in sales at the end of the year, the decline in sales of automobile brands at the beginning of the year deserves more attention from the market, because some 4S stores often calculate the orders before the end of last year after the year, so as not to make the sales at the beginning of the year too ugly. On the other hand, January was the peak season of automobile sales in previous years. After all, many consumers took advantage of the new year to go home, I will rush to buy the car years ago, and the sales volume of all brands will not be poor.<br>From this perspective, the decline in sales of Great Wall Motors in January may be more worthy of market attention.</p>
<h3 id="The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line"><a href="#The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line" class="headerlink" title="The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line"></a>The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line</h3><p>Judging from the trend of the capital market, the Great Wall stock price has entered a new round of decline. Since October last year, the Great Wall stock price has almost halved after falling from its high point. As of February 18, the share price of Great Wall Motors fell to 38. 25 yuan.<br>On the one hand, the capital market has entered the downward channel. On the other hand, from the storm of tank 300 delivery to the “core change door” of Euler good cat, and then to the recent shutdown of black cat and white cat, it seems that the transformation of the Great Wall is still a long way off.<br>2021 will be a year of ups and downs for the Great Wall. On the one hand, its 300 tanks, which mainly focus on small cross-country vehicles, have sold 84588 units, accounting for almost half of the domestic cross-country vehicles. On the other hand, as the production capacity of new vehicles is seriously lower than the market expectation, of course, the lack of core is one of the important factors. As time goes by, the market enthusiasm dissipates, and the growth expectation in the future is declining.<br>Reflected in the capital market, under the haze of the epidemic, the share price of Great Wall Motors rose nearly tenfold from the peak in 2020 to 2021. By the end of 2021, the popularity of individual models was no longer, the capital market returned to rationality, and the high point of Great Wall stock price fell sharply.<br>There are generally two reasons for the decline of the high point of auto enterprises. One is the sharp decline in sales volume, and investors are bearish on the future growth of brand models. On the other hand, the overall market expectation decreases. For example, after the rise of Tesla, the market will inevitably make new adjustments to the valuation of traditional auto brands, because in the stock growth, the growth of new energy brands may correspond to the decline of traditional brands.<br>Overall, the withdrawal of the market value of the Great Wall shows that the expectations of the capital market are declining, and the shutdown of some of its new energy models may once again be bad for the growth momentum of the Great Wall in the new energy market.<br>On February 15, two new black cat and white cat models of Great Wall Motor’s brand Euler stopped accepting orders. Officials said that the two models were forced to stop production because of the shortage of chips, the supply of spare parts and the decline of new energy subsidies. Tianyancha app information shows that Euler brand was founded in 2001 and has experienced five rounds of financing.<br>In June last year, Great Wall Motors released its 2025 strategic target, which mentioned that the target sales volume was 4 million units, of which 80% were new energy vehicles, and the expected revenue was 600 billion.<br>From the sales ranking of new energy cars in January this year, the Great Wall’s brand Euler has only one Euler good cat in the top 10. In January, the sales volume of black cats reached 8612, while the sales volume of Euler black cats was only 3891. The sales volume of BYD Han, the third highest in the sales volume list, reached 12781, and the sales volume of Wuling macro mini, the first, was 26682.<br>With the rapid development of new forces, transformation is the top priority of traditional automobile brands. However, from the perspective of sales volume, the electric transformation of great wall seems to be out of step with the pace of the industry. The reason may be that the multi brand strategy of Great Wall Motors is not going smoothly under the burden of fuel vehicle brands.</p>
<h3 id="Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy"><a href="#Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy"></a>Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy</h3><p>On the road of transformation, the Great Wall chose a “Shu Road”.<br>On the one hand, the wings of its new energy brand are not yet full, and the cash flow business that the group can rely on is still the fuel vehicle business. On the other hand, the market space of Harvard H6, the main sales force in the fuel vehicle market, is being squeezed by Geely, Chang’an and other competitors.<br>For example, in the traditional advantage SUV market of great wall, the models such as Xingyue l released by Geely in the past two years and cs75 under Chang’an have stronger product power. On the one hand, Haval’s response is to fight a price war with its competitors through the subdivision of H6 models. On the other hand, the VV series products under Wei brand have not opened a big gap in sales.<br>On the whole, facing the pressure of competitors step by step, Great Wall’s strategy seems to be to maintain the growth of fuel vehicle market through multi brand diversified expansion strategy.<br>An important reason supporting this decision is that the market demand has changed. On the one hand, with the automobile consumption track becoming a big red ocean track, but some segments of the track are still blue ocean market, such as the hard core cross-country track with a price range of 150000-250000 yuan. In fact, the success of the tank 300 is the success of the excavation subdivision.<br>In short, the change of consumers’ preferences promotes the further differentiation of market demand, resulting in the birth of a new blue ocean.<br>The popularity of tank 300 shows that there is no problem in the overall direction from large-scale accumulation to deep cultivation in market segments, which may also be the reason for the soaring share price of Great Wall in 2021. The retreat of the Great Wall stock price at the end of the year may be due to the potential problems found in the market.<br>There is no problem with the direction of market segmentation. The problem is that the brand front is too long.<br>From the perspective of brand positioning, Euler is more likely to be positioned as a fashion brand for young women, tanks are positioned as hardline cross-country, and Great Wall guns are positioned in the pickup truck market, focusing on villages and fourth and fifth tier cities.<br>If the brand front is too long, it will easily lead to the dispersion of resources. No matter in which market segment, once the market segment is verified, there will be competitors. Even if the segment track where Euler and tank are located is still the blue ocean market in the short term, the competitors will follow up quickly.<br>For example, in the field of hardline off-road, Chery’s brand jietu announced to officially enter this segment.<br>The launch of tank 300 is an important symbol of Great Wall Motor’s deep cultivation of market segments and high-end transformation. The popularity of the market highlights the problem of capacity climbing of tank 300. On the one hand, the production capacity is seriously disconnected from the short-term demand of the market and does not use the accumulation of brand reputation. On the other hand, when there are more and more players in the market segment, more and more resources will be required to be invested under competitive pressure. On the contrary, it will fall into long-term consumption, which will affect the profits of the group.<br>For example, Harvard H6 sales declined in 2017, followed by the launch of the red and blue standard Haval H6 coupe and the new Haval H6, and the number of models increased to 55. Under the market competition, 2018q3 Haval officially announced that Haval’s best-selling models were fully preferential, resulting in a sharp decline in profits in the quarter.<br>In the long run, a negative result of the multi brand front is that the resources of the group’s electric transformation may be further dispersed.<br>In fact, looking back at the development process of auto giants such as Ford and Volkswagen, it is not difficult to find that they have also experienced rapid brand expansion. Later, facts have proved that too many fronts are not conducive to the growth of the overall business. In the follow-up development, the waste of resources is increasing due to too many brands, and consumers’ brand cognition is further dispersed.<br>As a result, Volkswagen and Ford began to shrink their product lines again to further improve product efficiency. Later, Volkswagen launched the MQB platform and moved towards the route of intensive growth.<br>In fact, the Great Wall brand models have an obvious feature, that is, the popularity of new cars is very high, but there are not many hard power products that can really stand the test of time.<br>For great wall, H6 model is one of the few models that have been tested for a long time, which gives great wall the opportunity to launch brand-new Wei brand, tank, Euler and other follow-up brands and deeply cultivate the market segments. How much trial and error space the traditional fuel vehicle market can bring to the transformation of new energy may be a question that needs to be considered.</p>
<h3 id="Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments"><a href="#Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments" class="headerlink" title="Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments"></a>Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments</h3><p>A practical problem is that with the continuous growth of the new energy vehicle market, the transformation time of traditional brands is shortening.<br>Under the double score policy, the performance of new energy vehicles will directly affect the growth of the overall business of the brand group. On the other hand, with the introduction of fuel vehicle sales schedules all over the world, traditional brands urgently need new energy to open up new large-scale growth.<br>The transformation road of great wall new energy seems to be still long.<br>In addition to the expected future growth, the quality problem of Euler brand models is also the threshold that Great Wall Motors must cross in its transformation.<br>According to the statistics of vehicle quality network, from December to February 19, 2021, the quality complaints about Euler’s good cat ranked first. In addition to the publicity problems, there are also some problems such as body accessories and electrical appliances. In addition, there are a series of problems such as video and audio faults, on-board interconnection faults and so on.<br>From the distribution of product problems, the complaints about Euler on the vehicle quality online also seem to reflect the maladjustment of Great Wall Motors on the road of transforming new energy. If this does not adapt to the long-term, it may affect the long-term growth of Euler brand.<br>User reputation is the first vitality. Product quality problems can have a far-reaching impact on the accumulation of brand reputation and long-term sales growth.<br>For example, the reputation of German brands has declined in the past two years, while the reputation and sales volume of Japanese brands are increasing. To a certain extent, this is the long-term impact caused by product quality differences. As far as the Great Wall is concerned, this point deserves vigilance.<br>The most important thing in the transformation of traditional automobile brands to new energy is scale.<br>Why can Tesla succeed? Not because of how amazing Tesla Model s is. Instead, model 3 completed the rapid scale of the new energy market in a short time through price reduction.<br>Some domestic manufacturers are aware of this. For example, SAIC launched Wuling Hongguang Mini. On the one hand, the substantial growth of sales volume has brought a lot of points to fuel vehicles. On the other hand, in this process, they unknowingly completed the brand transformation, laying the groundwork for Wuling brand to launch electric products in the future.<br>A reality that great wall has to face is that the Euler brand with gender preference may be difficult to lay the foundation for long-term market growth through effective scale.<br>From the perspective of market strategy, for automobile brands, the women’s market is a blue ocean market after hardline off-road, but one thing that can not be ignored is that the main force of the current automobile consumption market is, on the one hand, the family as the unit, on the other hand, the market consumer group is still the male group.<br>Great Wall’s biggest weakness in positioning the Euler brand may be that the overly obvious gender label naturally rejects the mainstream car owners.<br>In other words, even if the good cat and other models under the Euler brand can sell more than 10000 vehicles per model, its brand influence and reputation may be far less capable of driving sales than the new energy brands of other fuel vehicle manufacturers. From the perspective of long-term growth, the brand of Euler will be the main place to enter the market.</p>
<h3 id="Write-at-the-end"><a href="#Write-at-the-end" class="headerlink" title="Write at the end:"></a>Write at the end:</h3><p>The transformation of traditional automobile manufacturers into new energy requires not only changing products, but also changing thinking.<br>The strategy of multi brand expansion of Great Wall Motor’s segment market can indeed meet the consumers of the segment market and enjoy the blue ocean dividend of the segment market in the early stage. However, in order to tap these segments for a long time, it needs a higher product power moat, and the sustainability of the product life cycle may be limited, resulting in a waste of resources.<br>In the long run, this is not conducive to the transformation and development of the whole Great Wall group. Next, how to capture the eyes of capital and realize the scale of new energy business more efficiently may still be a problem that needs in-depth reflection for the Great Wall.<br>This article is from WeChat public No. ID:IPOxscj, the author of the 36 official account of the company.</p>

          <p>According to techcrunch, Congo based start-up Jambo recently announced that it had raised $7.5 million in seed funds, including coinbase ventures, 3aC, Alameda research, tiger global, Delphi ventures, alliancedao, defiance capital, yield guild games, polygon studios, and some angel investors from Web3 ecosystem, For example, Sandeep nailwal, co-founder and CEO of polygon, Santiago r Santos, former parafi partner, do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of terrain labs and partners of Delphi digital piers kicks participated in this round of investment.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>The start-up company “Jambo” was founded in November 2021. They are committed to building “Web3 super application” in Africa and obtain income opportunities through the logic of “learning, playing and making money”. Some experts said that Southeast Asia has become one of the best markets of Web3, and Africa is about to be overturned by Web3. Startups such as axie infinity and yield guild games are located in Southeast Asia and have raised millions of dollars in venture capital. The combination of rapid population growth, stable smartphone penetration, increased adoption of cryptocurrency, low per capita GDP and high unemployment makes Africa the next mature place of Web3.<br>James Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Jambo, said that Jambo hopes to add millions of users to Web3 in Africa through its application. Similar to axie infinity and other guilds, users can only earn income when playing games in revenue sharing mode, while “Jambo” adopts a two-way approach, allowing its users to earn income when participating in web2 and Web3 activities.<br>For example, users can save data expenses when using “Jambo”. James Zhang explained that “Jambo” can get a discount of nearly 70% in cooperation with telecom suppliers and sell it directly to users at a discount of 50% of the original cost. “This is one of our main user acquisition strategies. We hope to double the call time and data of each African.”<br>Second, “Jambo” is working with social media companies, so users can earn tokens when viewing their content on their apps, which can be converted into cash income. “By working with these social media companies, we tokenize part of their advertising budget and provide it directly to end users,” James Zhang said.<br>In addition, James Zhang said that at present, there are no Web3 games from Africa that make money through games because of the lack of certain infrastructure. Jambo wants to build such infrastructure. Nevertheless, “Jambo” does not intend to take a share of users’ income. Instead, Jambo’s revenue will come from the web2 model - charging advertising fees and commissions by selling call time and data.<br>As the “gateway to Web3 in Africa”, James Zhang said that Jambo will test more than 10 games in the coming months to introduce its operation to users. “Education is at the heart of our work, because I don’t think there is a shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can consider making a profit at the end of the day or start acquiring users again, which is why we launch education courses on Web3,” he said.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>“Every component in our super app is actually designed to help ordinary people make money, such as watching videos to make money and save data expenses. So ideally, within three to six months after our app goes online, ordinary people can make $50 a month by playing axie infinity and another $20 a month by watching videos.”<br>“Jambo” is expected to release its beta version in the second quarter and officially launch in the third quarter. “What wechat has done in China,” Jambo “will also do in Africa. We are also pleased to support this a + team to become a Web3 super application on the African continent,” Web3 investor and former parafi partner Santiago r Santos said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Wen Silai yuan<br>Editor Su Jianxun<br>On February 21, Huawei released the latest wireless product solutions, mainly for operators, providing TDD third-generation massive MIMO products and FDD ultra wideband multi antenna series.<br>The so-called TDD (time division duplex) and FDD (frequency division duplex) refer to different information transmission modes. Huawei’s products released this time cover two modes, which will cooperate and eventually move towards “multiple frequencies and one network”.<br>Compared with the past, the third generation products can be configured with lower transmission power, reduce energy consumption by about 30%, and have a wider coverage. On the other hand, compared with the second generation products, the antenna array is nearly twice as many and the signal is stronger. The commercial FDD massive MIMO released by Huawei this time can increase the 4G network capacity by three times. If it is upgraded to 5g, the capacity can be increased by five times.<br>They also launched corresponding solutions for residential areas, urban hotspots and other scenes, which can be deployed by operators in a minimalist manner. This is also the only distributed m-mimo (large-scale multiple input and output technology) in the industry. Compared with 4t4r (four transmitting antennas and four receiving antennas), this scheme has a four times increase in network capacity, mainly for the demand of 5g in indoor scenes such as railway stations and shopping malls.<br>Operators have always wanted to have more products with large bandwidth and multiple antennas. Huawei has always been the industry leader in this technology. For a long time, mobile phones accounted for the majority of Huawei’s revenue. Now, operators and enterprise businesses will become the main body again.<br>According to Huawei’s financial report for the first half of 2021, in the first half of last year, Huawei’s consumer business fell 47% year-on-year, operator business fell 14.2% year-on-year, and enterprise business including Huawei cloud increased 18.2% year-on-year. It can be expected that compared with the steep decline of consumer business, operator business and enterprise business will become the key in the future.<br>Of course, the business of Huawei operators is also under pressure. Huawei 5g equipment has been abandoned in Europe. However, compared with mobile phone business, the decline of operator business will be relatively slow.<br>However, Huawei obviously continues to invest in 5g technology research and development. The products released this time also represent that Huawei will not give up 5g dividends. The next generation communication network is far from universal. At this time window, Huawei also hopes to build a deeper moat.</p>

          <p>This winter Olympics is not only a feast of sports, but also a feast of science and technology. The application of 5g, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other technologies fully demonstrates the power of science and technology and the concept of innovation. It is reported that a total of 212 technologies have been applied in the Beijing Winter Olympics, involving more than 60 subdivided application scenarios, of which 4 technologies are launched for the first time in the world and 33 technologies are used for the first time in the Winter Olympics.<br>Behind the opening and closing ceremonies and Winter Olympic competition facilities that amaze the world, it is inseparable from the technical support of many domestic science and technology enterprises. According to statistics, more than 70 enterprises have contributed to the Winter Olympics, including the opening ceremony, competition clothes, playground and so on.<br>In this article, the Hong Kong stock research society makes an inventory of the technical leaders behind the “black technology” of the Winter Olympics.</p>
<h3 id="Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast"><a href="#Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast" class="headerlink" title="Hard core technology helps visual feast"></a>Hard core technology helps visual feast</h3><p>First of all, there is a highlight of this year’s Winter Olympics, that is the “main torch”.<br>The seemingly simple torch has many scientific and technological elements behind it. The outer streamer, inner streamer and combustion system are jointly tackled by Aerospace Science and technology group, Harbin Institute of technology and Hart, printed by 3D technology, and assembled after post polishing.<br>The main torch uses hydrogen with green environmental protection and good flammability as fuel, realizing zero carbon emission of the torch in the history of the Winter Olympic Games. It has been burning over the bird’s nest from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony. Meijin energy, power source and Haohua technology are the main suppliers of hydrogen energy for the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the main torch, the special effects at the opening and closing ceremonies are also impressive.<br>At the closing ceremony, along with the melody of “me and you”, the five dreamy rings of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games rose slowly and intersected with the snowflake torch platform to connect the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in an innovative way to commemorate the “double Olympic moment”.<br>In the classic song “farewell”, 80 dancers walked slowly into the entrance. With the steps of the dancers, a picture of weeping willows gradually appeared. In the center of the site, countless green beams pass through the snowflake torch platform and reach the sky to form a big tree composed of beams.<br>According to Wang zhiou, it is an innovative project to capture the real-time effect of the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony of the ice and snow by using the 3D technology of AR zhiou, which can enhance the realistic effect of the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony.<br>In the fancy skills of the opening and closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, the LED large screen is indispensable. With a total area of 11626 square meters, the Winter Olympics led stage is currently the largest LED stage in the world.<br>The ground screen is jointly manufactured by listed companies lyade, BOE and Zhouming technology. Lyade provides more than 7000 square meters (the central part of the ground screen), and BOE and Zhouming technology provide about 4500 square meters (the semi arc parts on both sides of the ground screen). Among them, liad also undertook many LED display projects such as ice waterfall, ice cube, grandstand and playback system at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games.<br>In addition, in order to show the shocking light and shadow effect, the “true laser” display technology developed by Hangzhou Zhongke aurora is also adopted. This technology takes three primary color laser as the light source, and is the only display technology that can fully realize the latest international standard of bt.2020.<br>At the same time, in order to make the audience in front of the screen of more electronic devices better enjoy the Winter Olympics. Based on the 5g SA network of China Unicom, the 5g broadcasting equipment of the Olympic Broadcasting Service Company (OBS) Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony has realized the full scene mobile video live broadcast on the dedicated bearer channel, presenting the high-definition full scene of the Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony.<br>Before the opening ceremony, China Unicom specially designed for the “bird’s nest” and carefully created a 5g SA network with 300MHz bandwidth and full coverage without dead corners. During the opening ceremony, “bird’s nest” achieved the fastest rate of 1.5gbps downlink and 500mbps uplink, making the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games the largest and fastest network bandwidth in the history of the Olympic Games.<br>At the same time, the Winter Olympics also conducted a comprehensive cloud operation for the first time. According to the official microblog of the International Olympic Committee, the Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be broadcast globally through Alibaba cloud. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games will last about 1000 hours. The total production of broadcast content will reach 6000 hours, and will be broadcast in 4K Ultra HD format for the first time. Some important events will also be broadcast in 8K format.<br>This is another major technological progress since the satellite TV broadcasting of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games began. Olympic Broadcasting can reach billions of audiences around the world through the Olympic Broadcasting cloud supported by Alibaba cloud.</p>
<h3 id="The-most-special-“person”"><a href="#The-most-special-“person”" class="headerlink" title="The most special “person”"></a>The most special “person”</h3><p>In the Winter Olympics, in addition to Gu ailing, Su Yiming and other sports stars, some special “people” participated in the whole process, which was popular.<br>For example, a 22-year-old Beijing girl “Dongdong” served as the publicity official of Alibaba digital Winter Olympics.<br>In fact, she is a real-time virtual digital person driven by artificial intelligence. Backed by Ali artificial intelligence technology, she has real-life facial expressions and body movements, and has first-class delivery ability.<br>In addition to winter and winter, there is also a “anchor” with a higher appearance rate. She is the first AI sign language anchor to be built by Baidu Intelligent Cloud Xi Ling digital human platform. At the current Olympic Games, she served as the virtual anchor of CCTV news AI sign language, reporting the news of the Winter Olympic Games and broadcasting the event sign language live.<br>CCTV news AI sign language anchor appeared in the Winter Olympics. Compared with real people, she may have the hand speed of “fire shadow knot fingerprint”. Some netizens commented: “Mr. Zhu has found a sign language anchor who can fight in the first World War”.<br>Baidu intelligent cloud has built a large scale sign language action library, and has refined nearly 10 thousand sign language actions. The accuracy of the AI sign language anchors is 98.5%, which makes AI professional ability not lose the real person.<br>With the development of science and technology, virtual digital human has attracted more and more attention. Li Shiyan, head of Baidu Intelligent Cloud AI Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, believes that the number of people has not yet reached the scale industry, because digital human production technology threshold is high, the cycle is long, and the cost is high.<br>The Winter Olympics is a carnival feast for many digital people enterprises, but when digital people can be fully commercialized may need more waiting.<br>In addition to the virtual digital human, this winter Olympics, from smart venue construction to service guarantee, artificial intelligence and robot technology are widely used.<br>For example, on the first day of the torch relay of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the underwater robot held the torch tightly at the mouth of the ice cave with a mechanical arm, approached the amphibious robot, and completed the relay within 10 seconds.<br>In addition, the disinfection and cleaning robot is responsible for cleaning and disinfection to help the epidemic prevention in the competition area.<br>Epidemic prevention robots, guidance robots, logistics robots, cooking robots and other intelligent robots have made great contributions to the whole Olympic Games, and people look forward to their application in life.</p>
<h3 id="Winter-Olympics-“support-group”"><a href="#Winter-Olympics-“support-group”" class="headerlink" title="Winter Olympics “support group”"></a>Winter Olympics “support group”</h3><p>At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Chinese athletes won 9 gold medals through hard work. The smooth progress of the fierce competition is also inseparable from the support of a large number of technology companies inside and outside the stadium.<br>First of all, when it comes to the game, we should mention sportswear. The official Winter Olympics uniforms and equipment are provided by Anta. In order to help all participants keep warm from the cold, Anta used two self-developed fabric technologies - hot technology and waterproof and moisture permeable technology.<br>By locking the heat, blazing technology can effectively prevent the loss of heat from the human body. High quality innovative materials and rigorous technology can achieve super warmth in the severe cold environment. Among them, the three-dimensional thermal insulation material poly thermal cotton has the performance of light and heat storage, and the blocking effect of heat loss is increased by about 20%. It can rise in temperature instantly and store heat efficiently. The use of far-infrared graphene material can significantly improve the far-infrared irradiation temperature rise, more than double the national standard.<br>In addition, super down is attached with a nano protective layer, which is waterproof and moisture-proof. At the same time, it increases the fluffy degree by 30% compared with ordinary down, so as to give better play to the long-term thermal effect of down and super warm.<br>Secondly, in terms of venue energy supply, the wind energy from Zhangbei, Hebei Province was transmitted to the three competition areas and 26 venues of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, realizing 100% green power supply for the first time in history. Shuguang computing power, as the “wind protection messenger” behind it, uses the new generation of domestic computing platform of Shuguang to provide computing power for Zhangbei power.<br>Dawning’s new generation of domestic computing platform provides a total of large-scale computing support services in fields such as wind, solar and electric power, making it possible for green energy to be more widely used, and has good development prospects under the goal of “double carbon”.<br>Back on the field, in order to ensure the smooth holding of the Winter Olympic Games, China Unicom launched 5g smart ambulance.<br>Its emergence has realized the continuous, real-time and multi-party cooperative remote first aid of “Winter Olympic site emergency vehicle support hospital”. In short, the medical staff on the ambulance can return the relevant data and information in the vehicle to the emergency center in real time through the 5g network in the vehicle. Hospital experts can see a doctor remotely through ultra-high definition video to achieve remote guidance and other measures.<br>Finally, as the official ticketing service partner of Beijing Winter Olympic Games, barley has achieved the goal of fully realizing the digital operation of ticketing.<br>On the eve of the closing ceremony, Timo Rumei, director of the television broadcasting and market development department of the IOC, who is responsible for Olympic ticketing affairs, said that the Beijing Winter Olympic ticketing system is the first digital ticketing system in Olympic history.<br>According to the Hong Kong Stock Research Institute, the system is based on cloud computing and digital technology, adopts Cloud Architecture, supports the cross regional deployment of Alibaba cloud’s global network, and can accommodate tens of millions of users online in real time. At the same time, the Olympic smart ticketing system is connected with the cloud computing power at a high speed, which can transmit and calculate in real time, and support the digital operation of multiple scenes such as cross seat drawing, automatic seat allocation and intelligent report. The service efficiency is five times higher than that of the traditional ticketing system.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>The Winter Olympics can be held smoothly, and the supporting lineup behind it can be described as “a gathering of stars”.<br>In addition to the above companies, there are more enterprises that provide relevant services and facilities for the Winter Olympic Games. For example, smart bed supplier Qisheng technology provides “weightless bed”; Dafeng Industrial Company provides competition intelligent system integration and overall solutions for sports venues related to the Winter Olympic Games; Nanshan Zhishang company participated in the design of Winter Olympics cold proof clothing and multi-functional clothing; Jinhyundai company participated in the construction of Beijing Winter Olympic power operation guarantee command platform project.<br>At the just concluded 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we saw the application of a large number of cutting-edge technologies. Enjoy the “most scientific and technological” Winter Olympics.<br>Many enterprises providing technical support behind the Olympic Games have demonstrated their strong scientific and technological strength.<br>Perhaps in the near future, whether it is “people” such as virtual digital people and intelligent robots, or 5g, cloud computing and other related technologies, after leaving the Olympic stage, they will eventually become meta universe games, holographic projection conferences, virtual digital people anchors and so on into our daily life.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:ganggushe, which is authorized by 36 krypton.</p>
