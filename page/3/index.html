          <p>According to techcrunch, Congo based start-up Jambo recently announced that it had raised $7.5 million in seed funds, including coinbase ventures, 3aC, Alameda research, tiger global, Delphi ventures, alliancedao, defiance capital, yield guild games, polygon studios, and some angel investors from Web3 ecosystem, For example, Sandeep nailwal, co-founder and CEO of polygon, Santiago r Santos, former parafi partner, do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of terrain labs and partners of Delphi digital piers kicks participated in this round of investment.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>The start-up company “Jambo” was founded in November 2021. They are committed to building “Web3 super application” in Africa and obtain income opportunities through the logic of “learning, playing and making money”. Some experts said that Southeast Asia has become one of the best markets of Web3, and Africa is about to be overturned by Web3. Startups such as axie infinity and yield guild games are located in Southeast Asia and have raised millions of dollars in venture capital. The combination of rapid population growth, stable smartphone penetration, increased adoption of cryptocurrency, low per capita GDP and high unemployment makes Africa the next mature place of Web3.<br>James Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Jambo, said that Jambo hopes to add millions of users to Web3 in Africa through its application. Similar to axie infinity and other guilds, users can only earn income when playing games in revenue sharing mode, while “Jambo” adopts a two-way approach, allowing its users to earn income when participating in web2 and Web3 activities.<br>For example, users can save data expenses when using “Jambo”. James Zhang explained that “Jambo” can get a discount of nearly 70% in cooperation with telecom suppliers and sell it directly to users at a discount of 50% of the original cost. “This is one of our main user acquisition strategies. We hope to double the call time and data of each African.”<br>Second, “Jambo” is working with social media companies, so users can earn tokens when viewing their content on their apps, which can be converted into cash income. “By working with these social media companies, we tokenize part of their advertising budget and provide it directly to end users,” James Zhang said.<br>In addition, James Zhang said that at present, there are no Web3 games from Africa that make money through games because of the lack of certain infrastructure. Jambo wants to build such infrastructure. Nevertheless, “Jambo” does not intend to take a share of users’ income. Instead, Jambo’s revenue will come from the web2 model - charging advertising fees and commissions by selling call time and data.<br>As the “gateway to Web3 in Africa”, James Zhang said that Jambo will test more than 10 games in the coming months to introduce its operation to users. “Education is at the heart of our work, because I don’t think there is a shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can consider making a profit at the end of the day or start acquiring users again, which is why we launch education courses on Web3,” he said.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>“Every component in our super app is actually designed to help ordinary people make money, such as watching videos to make money and save data expenses. So ideally, within three to six months after our app goes online, ordinary people can make $50 a month by playing axie infinity and another $20 a month by watching videos.”<br>“Jambo” is expected to release its beta version in the second quarter and officially launch in the third quarter. “What wechat has done in China,” Jambo “will also do in Africa. We are also pleased to support this a + team to become a Web3 super application on the African continent,” Web3 investor and former parafi partner Santiago r Santos said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Wen Silai yuan<br>Editor Su Jianxun<br>On February 21, Huawei released the latest wireless product solutions, mainly for operators, providing TDD third-generation massive MIMO products and FDD ultra wideband multi antenna series.<br>The so-called TDD (time division duplex) and FDD (frequency division duplex) refer to different information transmission modes. Huawei’s products released this time cover two modes, which will cooperate and eventually move towards “multiple frequencies and one network”.<br>Compared with the past, the third generation products can be configured with lower transmission power, reduce energy consumption by about 30%, and have a wider coverage. On the other hand, compared with the second generation products, the antenna array is nearly twice as many and the signal is stronger. The commercial FDD massive MIMO released by Huawei this time can increase the 4G network capacity by three times. If it is upgraded to 5g, the capacity can be increased by five times.<br>They also launched corresponding solutions for residential areas, urban hotspots and other scenes, which can be deployed by operators in a minimalist manner. This is also the only distributed m-mimo (large-scale multiple input and output technology) in the industry. Compared with 4t4r (four transmitting antennas and four receiving antennas), this scheme has a four times increase in network capacity, mainly for the demand of 5g in indoor scenes such as railway stations and shopping malls.<br>Operators have always wanted to have more products with large bandwidth and multiple antennas. Huawei has always been the industry leader in this technology. For a long time, mobile phones accounted for the majority of Huawei’s revenue. Now, operators and enterprise businesses will become the main body again.<br>According to Huawei’s financial report for the first half of 2021, in the first half of last year, Huawei’s consumer business fell 47% year-on-year, operator business fell 14.2% year-on-year, and enterprise business including Huawei cloud increased 18.2% year-on-year. It can be expected that compared with the steep decline of consumer business, operator business and enterprise business will become the key in the future.<br>Of course, the business of Huawei operators is also under pressure. Huawei 5g equipment has been abandoned in Europe. However, compared with mobile phone business, the decline of operator business will be relatively slow.<br>However, Huawei obviously continues to invest in 5g technology research and development. The products released this time also represent that Huawei will not give up 5g dividends. The next generation communication network is far from universal. At this time window, Huawei also hopes to build a deeper moat.</p>

          <p>This winter Olympics is not only a feast of sports, but also a feast of science and technology. The application of 5g, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other technologies fully demonstrates the power of science and technology and the concept of innovation. It is reported that a total of 212 technologies have been applied in the Beijing Winter Olympics, involving more than 60 subdivided application scenarios, of which 4 technologies are launched for the first time in the world and 33 technologies are used for the first time in the Winter Olympics.<br>Behind the opening and closing ceremonies and Winter Olympic competition facilities that amaze the world, it is inseparable from the technical support of many domestic science and technology enterprises. According to statistics, more than 70 enterprises have contributed to the Winter Olympics, including the opening ceremony, competition clothes, playground and so on.<br>In this article, the Hong Kong stock research society makes an inventory of the technical leaders behind the “black technology” of the Winter Olympics.</p>
<h3 id="Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast"><a href="#Hard-core-technology-helps-visual-feast" class="headerlink" title="Hard core technology helps visual feast"></a>Hard core technology helps visual feast</h3><p>First of all, one highlight of this year’s Winter Olympics is the “main torch”.<br>The seemingly simple torch has many scientific and technological elements behind it. The outer streamer, inner streamer and combustion system are jointly tackled by Aerospace Science and technology group, Harbin Institute of technology and Hart, printed by 3D technology, and assembled after post polishing.<br>The main torch uses hydrogen with green environmental protection and good flammability as fuel, realizing zero carbon emission of the torch in the history of the Winter Olympic Games. It has been burning over the bird’s nest from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony. Meijin energy, power source and Haohua technology are the main suppliers of hydrogen energy for the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the main torch, the special effects at the opening and closing ceremonies are also impressive.<br>At the closing ceremony, along with the melody of “me and you”, the five dreamy rings of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games rose slowly and intersected with the snowflake torch platform to connect the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in an innovative way to commemorate the “double Olympic moment”.<br>In the classic song “farewell”, 80 dancers walked slowly into the entrance. With the steps of the dancers, a picture of weeping willows gradually appeared. In the center of the site, countless green beams pass through the snowflake torch platform and reach the sky to form a big tree composed of beams.<br>According to Wang zhiou, visual effect director of the opening ceremony, in order to achieve realistic ice and snow effects, the opening and closing ceremonies use real-time capture, naked eye 3D, computer animation (CG), augmented reality (AR) and other technologies, which can be said to be a huge and complex digital innovation project.<br>In the fancy skills of the opening and closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games, the LED large screen is indispensable. With a total area of 11626 square meters, the Winter Olympics led stage is currently the largest LED stage in the world.<br>The ground screen is jointly manufactured by listed companies lyade, BOE and Zhouming technology. Lyade provides more than 7000 square meters (the central part of the ground screen), and BOE and Zhouming technology provide about 4500 square meters (the semi arc parts on both sides of the ground screen). Among them, liad also undertook many LED display projects such as ice waterfall, ice cube, grandstand and playback system at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games.<br>In addition, in order to show the shocking light and shadow effect, the “true laser” display technology developed by Hangzhou Zhongke aurora is also adopted. This technology takes three primary color laser as the light source, and is the only display technology that can fully realize the latest international standard of bt.2020.<br>At the same time, in order to make the audience in front of the screen of more electronic devices better enjoy the Winter Olympics. Based on the 5g SA network of China Unicom, the 5g broadcasting equipment of the Olympic Broadcasting Service Company (OBS) Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony has realized the full scene mobile video live broadcast on the dedicated bearer channel, presenting the high-definition full scene of the Winter Olympic Games opening ceremony.<br>Before the opening ceremony, China Unicom specially designed for the “bird’s nest” and carefully created a 5g SA network with 300MHz bandwidth and full coverage without dead corners. During the opening ceremony, “bird’s nest” achieved the fastest rate of 1.5gbps downlink and 500mbps uplink, making the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games the largest and fastest network bandwidth in the history of the Olympic Games.<br>At the same time, the Winter Olympics also conducted a comprehensive cloud operation for the first time. According to the official microblog of the International Olympic Committee, the Beijing Winter Olympic Games will be broadcast globally through Alibaba cloud. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games will last about 1000 hours. The total production of broadcast content will reach 6000 hours, and will be broadcast in 4K Ultra HD format for the first time. Some important events will also be broadcast in 8K format.<br>This is another major technological progress since the satellite TV broadcasting of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games began. Olympic Broadcasting can reach billions of audiences around the world through the Olympic Broadcasting cloud supported by Alibaba cloud.</p>
<h3 id="The-most-special-“person”"><a href="#The-most-special-“person”" class="headerlink" title="The most special “person”"></a>The most special “person”</h3><p>In the Winter Olympics, in addition to Gu ailing, Su Yiming and other sports stars, some special “people” participated in the whole process, which was popular.<br>For example, a 22-year-old Beijing girl “Dongdong” served as the publicity official of Alibaba digital Winter Olympics.<br>In fact, she is a real-time virtual digital person driven by artificial intelligence. Backed by Ali artificial intelligence technology, she has real-life facial expressions and body movements, and has first-class delivery ability.<br>In addition to winter and winter, there is also a “anchor” with a higher appearance rate. She is the first AI sign language anchor to be built by Baidu Intelligent Cloud Xi Ling digital human platform. At the current Olympic Games, she served as the virtual anchor of CCTV news AI sign language, reporting the news of the Winter Olympic Games and broadcasting the event sign language live.<br>CCTV news AI sign language anchor appeared in the Winter Olympics. Compared with real people, she may have the hand speed of “fire shadow knot fingerprint”. Some netizens commented: “Mr. Zhu has found a sign language anchor who can fight in the first World War”.<br>Baidu intelligent cloud has built a large scale sign language action library, and has refined nearly 10 thousand sign language actions. The accuracy of the AI sign language anchors is 98.5%, which makes AI professional ability not lose the real person.<br>With the development of science and technology, virtual digital human has attracted more and more attention. Li Shiyan, head of Baidu Intelligent Cloud AI Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, believes that the number of people has not yet reached the scale industry, because digital human production technology threshold is high, the cycle is long, and the cost is high.<br>The Winter Olympics is a carnival feast for many digital people enterprises, but when digital people can be fully commercialized may need more waiting.<br>In addition to the virtual digital human, this winter Olympics, from smart venue construction to service guarantee, artificial intelligence and robot technology are widely used.<br>For example, on the first day of the torch relay of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the underwater robot held the torch tightly at the mouth of the ice cave with a mechanical arm, approached the amphibious robot, and completed the relay within 10 seconds.<br>In addition, the disinfection and cleaning robot is responsible for cleaning and disinfection to help the epidemic prevention in the competition area.<br>Epidemic prevention robots, guidance robots, logistics robots, cooking robots and other intelligent robots have made great contributions to the whole Olympic Games, and people look forward to their application in life.</p>
<h3 id="Winter-Olympics-“support-group”"><a href="#Winter-Olympics-“support-group”" class="headerlink" title="Winter Olympics “support group”"></a>Winter Olympics “support group”</h3><p>At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Chinese athletes won 9 gold medals through hard work. The smooth progress of the fierce competition is also inseparable from the support of a large number of technology companies inside and outside the stadium.<br>First of all, when it comes to the game, we should mention sportswear. The official Winter Olympics uniforms and equipment are provided by Anta. In order to help all participants keep warm from the cold, Anta used two self-developed fabric technologies - hot technology and waterproof and moisture permeable technology.<br>By locking the heat, blazing technology can effectively prevent the loss of heat from the human body. High quality innovative materials and rigorous technology can achieve super warmth in the severe cold environment. Among them, the three-dimensional thermal insulation material poly thermal cotton has the performance of light heat storage, the heat loss barrier effect is increased by about 20%, and can instantly heat up and efficiently store heat. The use of far-infrared graphene material can significantly improve the far-infrared irradiation temperature rise, more than double the national standard.<br>In addition, super down is attached with a nano protective layer, which is waterproof and moisture-proof. At the same time, it increases the fluffy degree by 30% compared with ordinary down, so as to give better play to the long-term thermal effect of down and super warm.<br>Secondly, in terms of venue energy supply, the wind energy from Zhangbei, Hebei Province was transmitted to the three competition areas and 26 venues of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, realizing 100% green power supply for the first time in history. Shuguang computing power, as the “wind protection messenger” behind it, uses the new generation of domestic computing platform of Shuguang to provide computing power for Zhangbei power.<br>Dawning’s new generation of domestic computing platform provides a total of large-scale computing support services in fields such as wind, solar and electric power, making it possible for green energy to be more widely used, and has good development prospects under the goal of “double carbon”.<br>Back on the field, in order to ensure the smooth holding of the Winter Olympic Games, China Unicom launched 5g smart ambulance.<br>Its emergence has realized the continuous, real-time and multi-party cooperative remote first aid of “Winter Olympic site emergency vehicle support hospital”. In short, the medical staff on the ambulance can return the relevant data and information in the vehicle to the emergency center in real time through the 5g network in the vehicle. Hospital experts can see a doctor remotely through ultra-high definition video to achieve remote guidance and other measures.<br>Finally, as the official ticketing service partner of Beijing Winter Olympic Games, barley has achieved the goal of fully realizing the digital operation of ticketing.<br>On the eve of the closing ceremony, Timo Rumei, director of the television broadcasting and market development department of the IOC, who is responsible for Olympic ticketing affairs, said that the Beijing Winter Olympic ticketing system is the first digital ticketing system in Olympic history.<br>According to the Hong Kong Stock Research Institute, the system is based on cloud computing and digital technology, adopts Cloud Architecture, supports the cross regional deployment of Alibaba cloud’s global network, and can accommodate tens of millions of users online in real time. At the same time, the Olympic smart ticketing system is connected with the cloud computing power at a high speed, which can transmit and calculate in real time, and support the digital operation of multiple scenes such as cross seat drawing, automatic seat allocation and intelligent report. The service efficiency is five times higher than that of the traditional ticketing system.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>The Winter Olympics can be held smoothly, and the supporting lineup behind it can be described as “a gathering of stars”.<br>In addition to the above companies, there are more enterprises that provide relevant services and facilities for the Winter Olympic Games. For example, smart bed supplier Qisheng technology provides “weightless bed”; Dafeng Industrial Company provides competition intelligent system integration and overall solutions for sports venues related to the Winter Olympic Games; Nanshan Zhishang company participated in the design of Winter Olympics cold proof clothing and multi-functional clothing; Jinhyundai company participated in the construction of Beijing Winter Olympic power operation guarantee command platform project.<br>At the just concluded 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we saw the application of a large number of cutting-edge technologies. Enjoy the “most scientific and technological” Winter Olympics.<br>Many enterprises providing technical support behind the Olympic Games have demonstrated their strong scientific and technological strength.<br>Perhaps in the near future, whether it is “people” such as virtual digital people and intelligent robots, or 5g, cloud computing and other related technologies, after leaving the Olympic stage, they will eventually become meta universe games, holographic projection conferences, virtual digital people anchors and so on into our daily life.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:ganggushe, which is authorized by 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>The current situation of Haidilao fully shows that “opportunity” can also become a crisis.</p>
<h3 id="Huge-loss"><a href="#Huge-loss" class="headerlink" title="Huge loss"></a>Huge loss</h3><p>“The current bitter fruit can only be swallowed by ourselves”. On November 5, 2021, Haidilao released the store closing plan and the “woodpecker plan”, how big is the expansion “bitter fruit”? At present, this “bitter fruit” is enough to make it return to before liberation and return the total net profit of the company in the three years before listing to zero.<br>On the morning of February 21, Haidilao issued a profit warning, saying that compared with the net profit of 309 million yuan in 2020, it is expected to have a net loss of 3.8 billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan in 2021; At the same time, the revenue in 2021 is expected to exceed 40 billion yuan, an increase of more than 40% compared with the revenue of about 28.6 billion yuan in 2020.<br>This is the first annual loss of Haidilao since its listing in 2018. Affected by this announcement, Haidilao’s share price fell by 5.54% on the same day and closed at HK $19.08, a decrease of nearly 80% compared with the high of HK $85.80 in February last year, and the market value evaporated by about HK $350 billion.<br>For the gap between revenue and net profit, Haidilao said in its announcement that it was mainly caused by two reasons:<br>First, the one-time loss and impairment loss on the disposal of long-term assets caused by the closure of more than 300 restaurants and the decline of restaurant operating performance in 2021 totaled about RMB 3.3 billion to RMB 3.9 billion;<br>Second, the impact of global continuous changes and repeated epidemics, the rapid expansion of store network in 2020 and 2021 and the company’s internal management problems on the operation of Haidilao restaurant; Especially in the second half of 2021, the operation of Haidilao restaurant was significantly affected by the global regional epidemic outbreak and public health control measures, and its operating performance decreased compared with the second half of 2020. Overseas stores also experienced increased losses in 2021.<br>Although the impact of the epidemic has been mentioned many times in the announcement, it can be seen that the main cause of the performance loss of Haidilao is strategic error. In the first half of 2020, affected by the strictest epidemic situation and control, Haidilao lost 965 million yuan in net profit. After the recovery in the second half of the year, it turned loss into profit and gained 309 million yuan in net profit for the whole year. With the further relaxation of domestic epidemic control, if we follow the normal rhythm, the net profit in 2021 will increase on the basis of at least 309 million yuan. Why is there a serious loss?<br>The problem lies in contrarian expansion. Blind self-confidence, misjudgment of the epidemic situation, coupled with the temptation of preferential rent policies for shopping malls and properties, Haidilao “went against the trend and opened 544 new stores and restaurants when its performance was greatly impacted by the epidemic in 2020; In the first half of 2021, it continued to implement the aggressive expansion strategy and opened 299 stores. As of June 30, 2021, the total number of global stores of Haidilao was 1597.<br>The expansion of stores brought about a significant increase in costs and expenses, but the turnover rate and the average daily sales of the same store decreased one after another, and the company increased revenue without increasing profits. After realizing the problem, Haidilao decided to slow down and put a sharp brake on it, closing 300 stores in succession in the second half of the year. Between opening and closing, the impact is not just the change in the number of stores. The one-time loss and impairment loss are as high as about 3.3 billion yuan to 3.9 billion yuan, accounting for 87% of the total estimated loss in 2021.<br>It is worth mentioning that in the first half of 2021 alone, Haidilao also obtained a net profit of 94.529 million yuan, that is, the estimated loss of 3.8-4.5 billion yuan was generated in the second half of the year.<br>Compared with its previous financial reports, from 2018 to 2020, Haidilao’s net profits were 1.646 billion yuan, 2.345 billion yuan and 309 million yuan respectively, with a total of about 4.3 billion yuan. It can be said that once it returned to before liberation, it lost the net profits of the three years before listing in half a year. It has to be said that Haidilao’s adverse expansion had a “bad effect”.</p>
<h3 id="hemostasis"><a href="#hemostasis" class="headerlink" title="hemostasis"></a>hemostasis</h3><p>In order to stop the loss in time, Haidilao adopted the strategy of “breaking the arm to stop bleeding”, launched the “woodpecker plan” on November 5, 2021, and closed more than 300 stores with poor performance before December 31, 2021, some of which are “suspended”, and will wait for the opportunity to reopen in the future, with a rest cycle of no more than two years; Rebuild and strengthen some functional departments and restore the regional management system; Timely shrink the group’s business expansion plan. If the average turnover rate of the group’s restaurant is lower than 4 times a day, in principle, new Haidilao restaurant will not be opened on a large scale.<br>Comparing the financial report data of four years after listing, we can see that the turnover rate of Haidilao is not ideal: in the first half of 2021, the turnover rate of Haidilao is three times a day, and from 2018 to 2020, the turnover rate is five times a day, 4.8 times a day and 3.5 times a day respectively, which has decreased for four consecutive years. The “woodpecker plan” refers to no less than four times a day, which means that it is difficult to return to the level before the outbreak of the epidemic in 2020 in the short term.<br>While Haidilao squatted down to “tie their shoelaces”, houlang changed the slow pace in the past and accelerated the pace of expansion. Among them, Guangdong style hotpot Laowang and Seafood Hotpot Qixin tianxiangji submitted prospectuses to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in September 2021 and January 2022, intending to compete for the “third share of Hong Kong stock hotpot”. Both sides put forward ambitious expansion plans in the prospectus. According to the prospectus, as of the third quarter of 2021, the number of Qixin Tianmen stores was 250, and it is planned to open another 300 new stores in the three years from 2022 to 2024; At present, Laowang, which has less than 200 self operated stores, will also usher in a high outbreak period of stores, and plans to open 227 new stores in the next three years.<br>At the same time, like Haidilao, Banu Maodu hot pot, which belongs to Sichuan hot pot and is also positioned as a high-end hot pot, won a large amount of financing of more than 500 million yuan in June 2021, followed by Chongqing hot pot brand “elder martial brother Zhou” and elder sister Pei hot pot. Although there is still a certain gap between the above brands and Haidilao in terms of volume and brand value, with the blessing of capital, they are eroding Haidilao’s market share and diluting its advantages.<br>Among them, Banu was a “follower” of Haidilao in its early days. Later, it occupied a place in the field of high-end hot pot with its own product and service advantages. At present, there are only about 85 Direct stores in China, and the customer unit price is dozens of yuan higher than Haidilao, but the grand situation of queuing in its stores in various cities is very similar to Haidilao in its early years, and its prospect is also optimistic by the industry.<br>According to Shen Boyuan, a consumer consulting expert, it is necessary for Haidilao to stop and rest at this time. The implementation of the “woodpecker plan” is correct and necessary. He said: “at present, the hot pot market still has a certain growth space, and Sichuan hot pot is one of the most popular categories. Haidilao is still the first leading brand. The top priority is to revitalize its own service advantages and improve its internal management level. As long as it operates lean, there is still a great opportunity to regain the market.”<br>Of course, the operation of any enterprise is not smooth sailing. Many successful chain catering brands have experienced crises, and each crisis is a turnaround to a certain extent. Successful resolution will be a qualitative leap for enterprises.<br>After nearly 20 years of development, Haidilao has established a mature supply chain, products, management service system and brand value. These core assets give it the ability of sustainable development and are a solid guarantee for its breaking journey. It will take some time to verify whether the “woodpecker plan” can finally get Haidilao out of the dilemma and return to the peak. We might as well be more patient.<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:fbc180, author: Li Huanhuan, 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>The business of cross-border e-commerce is becoming more and more lively.<br>Recently, the official website of damonstudio, a cross-border women’s clothing independent station under byte beat, announced that damonstudio will stop operation from February 11, 2022. At this time, it is only more than three months since its domain name registration.<br>Damonstudio was founded against sheen, which has become a model for Internet giants to emulate since the cross-border e-commerce Unicorn sheen became popular all over the world. In addition, the company also expanded tiktok’s e-commerce team on a large scale in 2021, and launched the Independent E-commerce application Fanno overseas.<br>The overseas e-commerce road of byte beating reveals uncertainty and needs to continue to wait and see. However, during the same period when dmonstudio announced its shutdown, more players were eager to try.<br>On February 15, according to Xinyan finance, wechat recently tested a cross-border e-commerce applet “cloud shopping around the world” to try to connect overseas businesses with wechat users; On February 16, Reuters reported that sheen is actively expanding its Singapore office and has changed its actual holding company to Singapore company roadget business PTE.<br>After more than ten years of development, the hot land of cross-border e-commerce has gathered Internet giants such as Alibaba, jd.com and byte beat, giving birth to unicorns, listed enterprises and countless hot money.<br>Favorable policies are introduced frequently. Since the Announcement No. 56 and 57 issued by the General Administration of Customs in 2014, the support of national and industrial policies has been increasing in the next few years.<br>At the beginning of 2022, cross-border e-commerce ushered in good news again - 27 new cross-border pilot zones will be established across the country, and the policy dividends will continue to be released.<br>However, with the support of all parties, the cross-border e-commerce field has not ushered in players who break through the siege. It was not until the birth of sheen in recent two years that a player who could tear a hole in the territory of e-commerce giant Amazon really appeared.<br>At the same time, in 2022, the rising cost of raw materials and the reduction of logistics efficiency of cross-border e-commerce continue. In the United States, India and other places, players will still be seriously affected by geography.<br>On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises, of which express was included for the first time.<br>How to eat the trillion cake of cross-border e-commerce in 2022?</p>
<h3 id="01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage"><a href="#01-after-ten-years-at-sea-the-market-is-still-savage" class="headerlink" title="01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage"></a>01 after ten years at sea, the market is still savage</h3><p>Internet giants’ exploration of cross-border e-commerce can be traced back to more than a decade ago.<br>At that time, with the gradual saturation of the domestic e-commerce industry, Internet giants invariably turned their attention to overseas markets.<br>Ali founded the online wholesale trading platform for the global market - Express in 2010, and wholly acquired American Vendio company to connect with express; JD’s cross-border exploration began in 2011, successively opening JD English station, Russian station and Spanish station to enter the overseas e-commerce market.<br>Before Alibaba founded express, domestic cross-border e-commerce experienced early development and realized a complete online transaction chain of transaction, payment and logistics. Lanting Jishi, Milan and other well-known cross-border e-commerce platforms have sprung up.<br>Lanting Jishi sells by self built stations, which is very similar to the independent station mode promoted later, while the opposite is the platform mode. The platform does not participate in the purchase and sales of goods, but the medium of transaction.<br>Lanting Jishi was listed in US stocks as early as 2013 and became the “first share of China’s cross-border e-commerce”. At that time, the development focus of most Chinese e-commerce enterprises was still at home, and the overseas e-commerce businesses of Alibaba and JD were also challenged.<br>In 2012, when Jingdong English station went online, Shi Tao, vice president of Jingdong Mall, once announced that it would achieve $100 million in Jingdong’s overseas business within three years, but after three years, Jingdong English station still didn’t improve. In the same period, Alibaba express was busy with the transformation, officially turning from C2C to B2C.<br>In the vast overseas, there is not much room for the development of Chinese enterprises. In 2009, the Sino US trade conflict began to take shape. In contrast, the European market has a relatively stable political environment and high consumption capacity, which is suitable for Chinese enterprises to achieve the goal of going to sea. This year, Lanting Jishi began to launch European sites, and a large number of enterprises began to pour into Europe. However, it is worth noting that at that time, high-end consumer markets such as Europe and the United States were mostly controlled by head players such as Amazon.<br>Chinese enterprises can only avoid the sharp edge of leading players such as Amazon and open up emerging markets in countries such as Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.<br>In recent years, cross-border e-commerce has flourished. According to Analysys data, the proportion of cross-border e-commerce in total foreign trade has increased year by year, from 15.71% in 2017 to 22.03% in October 2021. From January to October 2021, the scale of cross-border e-commerce industry reached 6.98 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 25.47%.<br>However, although the cross-border e-commerce industry has experienced a dividend period of rapid development and an elimination period of fierce competition in the past decade, the market is still savage.<br>For a long time, the services of those platforms that seem to be successful are not mature. The distribution timeliness of overseas e-commerce was once very backward. Sellers were used to “selling winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter”.<br>It was not until recent years that Chinese e-commerce enterprises began to expand their business scope. Expand from overseas warehouses and third-party warehouses to self owned logistics networks and cross-border e-commerce industrial parks, rather than focusing on online sites as in the early days. The delivery time has been much faster, but it has only been delivered within 7 days to “72 hours” in a few urban areas.<br>The multinational home-based restrictions under the influence of the epidemic in 2020 once led to the outbreak of online sales. However, after 2021, behind a series of events such as “one container is difficult to find” of port containers, cross-border e-commerce has experienced the phenomenon of rising costs of logistics, raw materials and tariffs, difficulties in customs clearance and inspection, and reduced logistics efficiency. The difficult situation of small and medium-sized sellers has also slowed down the growth of the platform.<br>Geopolitical influence is also intensifying. On February 18, the list of “notorious markets” in the United States involved a large number of domestic enterprises. In addition to including express for the first time, Dunhuang, a cross-border e-commerce platform, was “named” again this year. The impact is not limited to the United States. There have been media reports that Ali’s international business in India is still shrinking.<br>After a long time of model exploration, the road of overseas e-commerce of giants is still difficult and far from reaching the harvest period.</p>
<h3 id="02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode"><a href="#02-“second-spring”-of-independent-station-mode" class="headerlink" title="02 “second spring” of independent station mode"></a>02 “second spring” of independent station mode</h3><p>Independent station is nothing new, but it still rises rapidly in 2020 and continues to be hot in 2022, attracting giants and capital to bet.<br>Sheen, which started in Ningbo, became a blockbuster and became the most installed shopping app in the United States by surpassing Amazon. The rise of sheen is inseparable from its flexible supply chain system, social media marketing ability and China’s tax relief for cross-border e-commerce.<br>It is worth noting that sheen is an independent ecological station.<br>According to Bloomberg, sheen achieved $10 billion in sales in 2020, a year-on-year increase of more than 250%. In this ecosystem, only one of them can achieve an annual revenue of 10 billion US dollars.<br>This also means that the ecology of the independent station has not been fully reclaimed.<br>The rise of independent stations is closely related to the progress of SaaS station building system technology. The construction threshold and cost of the website are reduced, so that sellers can realize the most basic website construction for thousands of yuan. By selecting more third-party plug-in services, sellers can also obtain services at a low cost.<br>This year, the field of cross-border e-commerce SaaS is still developing rapidly. In January 2022, JD group announced its cooperation with Shopify. JD will open a commodity pool based on JD supply chain network for Shopify global merchants through DTC independent station. It can be seen that SaaS tools support cross-border e-commerce platforms. In the same month, the global e-commerce independent station SaaS platform shopkeeper technology announced that it had completed a C1 round of financing with a total amount of US $150 million, which was led by Softbank vision phase II fund. In the past two years, cross-border e-commerce SaaS service providers have also continued to be hot.<br>Compared with the threshold and cost, what can attract sellers more is the private domain traffic created by independent stations. At present, mainstream platforms such as Amazon and express are gradually crowded, with fierce competition among sellers, difficult access to public domain traffic and high cost.<br>A large number of cross-border e-commerce platforms are attacking cities and territories with the main low price strategy, which also leads to the pressure on their revenue and profits. When they encounter market changes, these platforms are also the first to be affected. Last November, vova, known as “European pinduoduo”, encountered tens of thousands of sellers to protect their rights because of “running away”.<br>For sellers, independent stations still have dividends, which is more likely to give birth to the story of “sudden wealth”.<br>Overseas short video social platforms can also guide these sites. In particular, the rise of new traffic platforms such as tiktok has increased the traffic channels of overseas sellers.<br>However, these traffic platforms may also have their own “ideas”. From tiktok e-commerce to dmonstudio and Fanno, we have never given up the business of cross-border e-commerce. At the end of last year, Zhang Yiming mentioned in his internal objectives that further exploration will be focused on three new business directions in 2021, including cross-border e-commerce.<br>Not only tiktok, Facebook’s exploration in the field of e-commerce has never stopped. When social media starts to make e-commerce layout, with strong users as the basis of e-commerce business, it is difficult for those independent station players not to have a sense of crisis.<br>No one can predict whether the independent station is the end of cross-border e-commerce or just a small stone to the market. The development of independent station mode still needs to wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future"><a href="#03-where-will-cross-border-e-commerce-go-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?"></a>03 where will cross-border e-commerce go in the future?</h3><p>Chinese players want to attack the cross-border e-commerce market. Their biggest opponents are not only Amazon and other players who occupy the market, but also the dramatically changing overseas market environment. How to overcome obstacles and win overseas is still a difficult problem.<br>The rapid development of live e-commerce overseas has shown players a new way.<br>The development of overseas live broadcast e-commerce is relatively late. In 2019, Amazon launched the live broadcast function. Last year, social platforms such as Facebook and instagram launched live delivery. This year, Amazon and other e-commerce giants, Facebook and other social media are still overweight live e-commerce.<br>As the market is still in its infancy, the development of live e-commerce business of local giants is also relatively slow, which is the opportunity for Chinese players.<br>At present, Kwai Tong and TikTok have begun the layout of overseas direct seeding providers, and the fast hands also say that they will accelerate the development of live broadcasting business overseas.<br>However, this road is not so easy. Tiktok rarely mentioned live data. Foreign media reported that tiktok had conducted two live shopping activities with Wal Mart, but the viewing data was not ideal.<br>On the one hand, overseas users are not familiar with the mode of live shopping. On the other hand, the current common dilemma of cross-border e-commerce is that it relies on popular single products to promote sales, and the brand attribute is secondary, which also leads to the difficulty of selecting products for live shopping.<br>Previously, in the best-selling list of Amazon and express, the old and new products changed quickly, while most of the products at the top had no brands, so they were easy to be replaced and eliminated.<br>This is also the embodiment of these platforms chasing category dividends. Compared with product capabilities, they rely more on operation means. In the long run, cross-border e-commerce platforms should strengthen brand attributes while building explosive products.<br>In addition, in the field of e-commerce, business flow and logistics are indispensable.<br>In recent years, China’s logistics enterprises are also speeding up going to sea. In 2021 alone, most players entered the game.<br>In May 2021, Zhongtong international realized that the normal time limit for customs clearance and delivery in Yangon, Myanmar was “72 hours”, and the whole territory distribution was an additional day; At the end of June, Yuantong International’s freight routes were expanded to East Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan, and South and Southeast Asian countries such as Pakistan; In September, SF holdings completed the acquisition of 51.5% equity of Kerry Logistics; In October, Baishi joined hands with Changhong to explore the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia.<br>Their participation can provide the underlying logistics foundation for the cross-border e-commerce platform. In addition, the cross-border e-commerce platform itself also pays close attention to building a global logistics network, so as to provide strong support for the development of overseas e-commerce business.<br>An earlier batch of cross-border e-commerce companies have begun to build their own overseas warehouses. Although this will cause enterprises to spend a lot of costs and occupy a lot of working capital, once the overseas warehouses become large-scale, it will help the platform strengthen the supervision of merchants’ product quality, and ensure the reliable source of products when cooperating with brands. More importantly, it will also greatly reduce the logistics time.</p>
<h3 id="04-ending"><a href="#04-ending" class="headerlink" title="04 ending:"></a>04 ending:</h3><p>After more than ten years of development, cross-border e-commerce is far from the end, and the fierce competition has not abated. From drainage, supplier development, to operation, logistics and services, each link is testing the cross-border e-commerce platform, not to mention more uncontrollable factors.<br>However, for Chinese players, we have a first mover advantage in new models such as live e-commerce. In the past, as a world factory, China has caught up with the upsurge of intelligent manufacturing, and more and more new categories, brands and products can be exported overseas.<br>I believe that given more patience and time, more giants from China will be born in the field of cross-border e-commerce.<br>This article is from WeChat official account “Zhang Dongwei” (ID:zhangdongwei19750613), author: Zhang Dongwei, 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>Key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Cambodian “blood slave” incident has put 58 cities on the cusp of the storm. Many 58 employees in the same city said frankly to Sina technology that false information is the “ancestral problem” of the company.</li>
<li>On China’s judicial documents online, 5638 documents can be found by searching “58 cities” and “causes of criminal cases”. Many criminals recruit accomplices and look for criminal targets in 58 the same city.</li>
<li>It is rumored that 58 companies in the same city have heard Yao Jinbo’s laissez faire attitude towards false information on the grounds that “the penalty loss due to false information is less than the loss due to business adjustment”.<br>“58 city, a magical website!” This advertising word became popular from Yang Mi’s mouth and spread all over the streets.<br>But for those victims, the “magical” 58 city brings nightmares.<br>According to the information on the official website of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, a man surnamed Li was attracted by false job advertisements on the Internet and was coerced by criminal gangs to smuggle into Cambodia. Later, he was illegally detained by the early online gambling and electronic fraud gang in Sihanouk port, and was drawn a lot of blood for many times, resulting in his life in danger. The man mentioned in an interview that his nightmare began with a job advertisement in the same city. The advertisement claims that a nightclub in Guangxi recruits security guards with a salary of 6000 yuan per month.<br>In other words, without this advertisement, men might not have suffered accidents.<br>A few days ago, 58 city responded to the matter: it has been communicated to the relevant departments, the case is under continuous investigation, and it has not been determined that the victim saw the recruitment information in 58 city, nor the recruitment information released by the corresponding enterprise.<br>Whether the same city is really involved in the case remains to be determined by the investigation results of the police of the two countries. But for a long time, the accusations of fraud in 58 cities have never stopped.<h3 id="False-information-58-ancestral-problems-in-the-same-city"><a href="#False-information-58-ancestral-problems-in-the-same-city" class="headerlink" title="False information, 58 ancestral problems in the same city"></a>False information, 58 ancestral problems in the same city</h3>“58 false information in the same city is an ancestral problem.” A 58 city employee commented.<br>Before joining 58, she also suffered losses in renting a house in the same city. Not long after renting a house in 58 the same city, he was threatened by the black intermediary and had to move out of the house whose lease had not expired, and the remaining rent and deposit could not be taken back.<br>Her professional experience in 58 made her realize that false information is a difficult problem almost unsolvable in 58. Whether it is recruitment, renting or second-hand transactions, there are a large number of false information.<br>“In July 2018, my good friend resold a Jingdong card on 58 and was cheated by the screenshot of forged transfer records.” a user told Sina technology that before long, he himself encountered a new scam on the transfer under 58 and fell into a serial trap after being photographed by the buyer for idle items, Finally, the customer service forged by the fraudsters was cheated out of 2200 yuan on the grounds of “authentication is required for the collection of goods sold”.<br>The same case is not uncommon on the consumer service platform black cat.<br>In October 2020, a user saw a Guangzhou company recruiting a clerk in 58 cities, so he arrived at the interview place according to the time and place provided by the other party, but was asked to spend 430 yuan for certificates to start the interview. After the user paid for the certificate, he was asked to go home and wait for the work arrangement. After waiting for half a month, there was no news, so I went to ask for a refund again. So far, the refund has not arrived.<br>Some users complained that they encountered a black intermediary in the same city in 58. Under the name of “introducing to work in a bar”, they took themselves and three others to the so-called workplace. They were not only required to pay 300 yuan for clothing and 60 yuan for information, but also took their personal ID card to handle mobile phone cards.<br>…………<br>As of February 21, the number of complaints about 58 in the same city on black cat had reached 9656, and there were new complaints about 58 in the same city almost every day, mostly focusing on recruitment fraud, fraudulent use of domestic services, malicious misappropriation of funds and so on.<br>A former employee of 58 in the same city told Sina technology that next to the front desk of 58 headquarters building in Jiuxianqiao, Beijing, there is a room dedicated to receiving and mediating door-to-door defenders. Many of the door-to-door defenders are users who have encountered fraud and suffered great losses in 58 in the same city. “Almost every day, there is an endless stream. Before, the company was surrounded by defenders.” He said.<br>Sina science and technology found that there are not many criminal acts breeding in 58 cities.<br>For example, the judgment of case No. (2021) yuxingzhong No. 129 shows that Xinhua guarantee company has published advertisements in 58 cities and ganji.com (which has been merged by 58 cities) for extensive publicity, exaggerated its company strength and absorbed social public funds at high interest rates. Finally, the legal person of the company was convicted of fund-raising fraud and loan fraud.<br>Case number (2021), Chongqing 30 and case No. 2020 (2020) Yun sentence 1008, the suspect has found that the suspects were recruited by the couple in the 58 cities to transport drugs. Case number (2020) Yun punishment No. 1001 judgment shows that the suspect found the object of fraud through the rental information of 58 cities. Case number (2018), the sentence No. 356 of Xiang Ling, showed that the suspect had formed a fraud group by recruiting 58 confederates.<h3 id="Why-are-criminals-keen-on-58-recruitment"><a href="#Why-are-criminals-keen-on-58-recruitment" class="headerlink" title="Why are criminals keen on 58 recruitment?"></a>Why are criminals keen on 58 recruitment?</h3>The actual experience of sina technology found that the threshold for recruitment on 58 is quite low, and reducing the cost of crime has become the breeding ground for crime.<br>On the 58 same city website, Sina technology can choose to publish full-time recruitment information after making up a job information, address information and enterprise name at will. However, before confirming the release, 58 cities are forced to join the job seeker protection plan. This so-called security plan is actually a deposit. If a cash account is used, it only needs to pay 10000 yuan.<br>This deposit can be refunded, even if it is non refundable. For many criminals, due to the huge benefits, this cost is not enough to become an obstacle - the victim of the “blood slave case” in Cambodia was sold to a network investment company in Sihanouk port by the traffickers who recruited him at a price of US $18500 (about 117000 yuan).<br>On the introduction page of the job seeker security plan, Sina Technology found that 58 cities require two commitments for members and non members to join the plan - the recruitment information is true and effective, and the recruitment behavior conforms to the platform and national regulations. But in fact, there is little guarantee for 58 cities to fulfill this commitment, making it more difficult to verify the authenticity and effectiveness of recruitment information.<br>After the successful release of the position, if it is not certified by the enterprise, the released position information is likely to be taken off the shelf. However, it is not difficult to complete the enterprise certification. It not only provides the agency service of business license on the Internet, but also the information publisher can complete the enterprise certification through the business license and other materials obtained from other channels due to the lack of audit.<br>On the page of 58 city, there is a prompt that “all recruiters will be required to pass (enterprise) certification from July”. However, according to media reports, the statement of 58 city is very vague. It is not clear which July it is. Even the official customer service of 58 city provides different statements in the consultation.<br>“What 58 does is blue collar recruitment, which is more about sinking the market. What 58’s China talent network does is white-collar recruitment, which is of relatively higher quality.” A 58 former employee in the same city told Sina technology that in comparison, chinatalent.com can bring more income, so it invests more resources and has more strict audit. 58. The income brought by recruitment is relatively small, and the audit will be relatively loose. “If 58 recruitment review is more stringent, the willingness to use it will decline for small and micro enterprises.” He said.<br>This statement undoubtedly exposes the loopholes behind 58 recruitment. Due to the sinking market, users’ willingness to pay is low, the use threshold of small and micro enterprises is low, and the willingness to pay high amounts is weak, which leads to 58 recruitment falling into such a cycle - low income, lax audit, proliferation of false information and frequent accidents.<br>“It’s hard to say whether it really happened in 58 recruitment this time before the end of the investigation. But if it’s related to 58, it will undoubtedly face some rectification.” The former employee said.<br>However, Sina Technology also found on the 58 city recruitment page that compared with the intelligent positions such as finance, audit, design and development engineers provided by chinatalent.com, 58 recruitment provides physical positions such as side dishes, loading, courier, shopping guide and waiter.<br>The business model of 58 city also determines that it is difficult to rectify these false information and protect user information - 58 city heavily depends on the provision of information services to obtain income, and the main source of income is the fees paid by information publishers.<br>The last financial report before the privatization of 58 city shows that in the first quarter of 2020, 58 city revenue was 2.5603 billion yuan, the average number of paying merchants was about 2.7 million, and member services contributed 815.6 million yuan.<br>58 city relies on the local service industry. Due to the impact of the epidemic, the revenue and the average number of paying merchants in the same city in the first quarter of 2020 increased negatively on a double ring basis - its fourth financial report in 2019 showed that the total number of paying merchants in the same city was about 3.3 million, and the membership service contributed 1.11 billion yuan.<br>Today, 58 cities in the recovery channel with the epidemic under control have no motivation to crack down on false information and cut off their own financial resources. “What’s more, if the audit is strengthened, it means that many auditors need to be recruited in all business locations to complete online and offline audit, which is a huge expenditure.” The former employee said.<br>A 58 city company once said that in the previous negative public opinion event, Yao Jinbo, CEO of 58 city, had been advised to take the opportunity to change the business model to reduce the negative public opinion brought by false information. However, this proposal was flatly rejected by Yao Jinbo. His reason is that the income and cost brought by the business model adjustment are reduced, and the loss actually exceeds the loss caused by the punishment of false information. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the business model.<br>But this statement has not been officially confirmed. In April 2021, in the tide of antitrust, Yao Jinbo called on relevant departments to punish the monopoly behavior of competitors’ shells, which was quite eye-catching.<br>However, 58 people in the same city who have caused damage to users’ property and even life safety due to false information induction for many times may be the one who should be punished with a huge amount.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, Sina Technology (ID:techsina).

          <p>No one can’t live without an iron boss or a flowing executive.<br>Even the brothers who started a business after drinking millet porridge with Lei Jun are leaving one after another. The nearest one is Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12.<br>Before leaving office, he served as vice chairman and Secretary General of Xiaomi Technical Committee and was one of the earliest founding team members of Xiaomi. Even, he once showed his love in an interview with the media, “I just married Xiaomi.”<br>Before Li Weixing, Lei Jun just sent off Chang Cheng, vice president of the company and general manager of Xiaomi mobile phone products department at the end of January 2022. Chang Cheng comes from Lenovo and is one of the members of Lei Jun’s “Avenger alliance”.<br>Before Chang Cheng, Lei Jun bid farewell to Zhou Shouzi, President of Xiaomi International Department, who made great contributions to Xiaomi’s investment and listing. After leaving Xiaomi, Zhou Shouzi switched to Zhang Yiming’s command, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>Seeing off the brothers one after another was Liu qiangdong.<br>A few months ago, Zhou Bowen, chairman of Jingdong Technical Committee and President of Jingdong Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Xu Ling, head of the group’s Strategy Department known as the “father of IOUS” of Jingdong, and Xiao Jun, vice president of Jingdong group and President of X business unit, left successively.<br>For Liu qiangdong, this may have been commonplace. There have been too many executives coming in and out of Jingdong in recent years. Jingdong has transported many management talents for the retail and fresh food industries. A few years ago, Lei Jun also said, “no veterans, no inheritance. No recruits, no future.”<br>Of course, the resignation of senior executives is an ordinary thing, but it is not necessarily simple behind the ordinary. Generally speaking, they either leave for personal or family reasons, or have a better place to go, or they are forced to leave because they can’t satisfy their boss. But this is also a window to observe a company, so that we can see its development status, strategic changes, future direction, etc.<br>People are the opposite of the company.</p>
<h3 id="01-Xiaomi-transition"><a href="#01-Xiaomi-transition" class="headerlink" title="01 Xiaomi transition"></a>01 Xiaomi transition</h3><p>Xiaomi confirmed to the media that Li Weixing has indeed left and wants to return to his hometown in Guangzhou.<br>Li Weixing, who grew up in Guangzhou and studied computer science at Sun Yat sen University, first joined Microsoft in 2005 to be responsible for the research and development of windows phone camera software. In 2009, Lin bin, who was at Google, was ready to start a business with Lei Jun, so he introduced his little alumni Li Weixing to Lei Jun.<br>According to Li Weixing’s memory, Lei Jun talked with him for several hours, talked about some things he had done and was doing, talked about the current situation of the mobile phone industry, his views on smart phones, the goal of making Xiaomi mobile phones, etc. “It’s mutual understanding.”<br>Lei Jun also revealed that he met more than 100 people in three months at that time. I always have a chance to talk about who I can meet and what I want to do.<br>To a certain extent, Li Weixing saw that Lei Jun still had a halo and decided to join in a few days later.<br>First from the left: Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12<br>In the early days, Li Weixing was responsible for the development of MIUI in Xiaomi. Even, he didn’t have much expectations for Xiaomi and Lei Jun. According to the Mars laboratory, Li Weixing believed only one tenth of Lei Jun’s first big cake for Xiaomi. “At that time, the expectation was not so high, but it was very satisfied to achieve the effect of big cake.”.<br>After Xiaomi went public in 2018, Lei Jun made a large-scale organizational structure adjustment, and Li Weixing emerged as a young man.<br>Lei Jun set up four new Internet business departments, and Li Weixing became the general manager of Internet Department 1, reporting directly to Lei Jun. Internet department I is composed of some departments of MIUI and some departments of Xiaomi mutual Entertainment Department, which is responsible for MIUI core experience, technology middle stage, commercial product R &amp; D and advertising sales, game distribution, business cooperation and MIUI international business.<br>Lei Jun explained, “we must hand over the front-line business position to young people, so that young talents can emerge and make achievements like in the early stage of entrepreneurship. We must constantly integrate fresh blood, so as to have a long-term mechanism for talent echelon handover.”<br>Only six months later, Li Weixing was transferred to the fourth Internet department as general manager. In 2020, Xiaomi Internet business department was integrated again, and Li Weixing was transferred to Xiaomi Technical Committee until he left.<br>In fact, after Xiaomi appeared on the market, Lei Jun realized that his past playing style was a bit like guerrillas or special teams, which created many miracles and trained a number of excellent cadres. However, we can’t rely on guerrilla warfare next. We should be able to fight mobile warfare, stalemate warfare and even large regiments.<br>Therefore, in addition to Li Weixing, the young people who grew up inside Xiaomi, they need to introduce a large number of talents from the outside.<br>With the idea of being high-end and competing with apple, Lei Jun introduced a number of executives who had worked in other mobile phone brands around 2020, such as Chang Cheng from Lenovo, Lu Weibing from Jinli, Miao Lei from Nubia, Wang Xiaoyan from chili, Yang zhe from Huawei, Zeng Xuezhong from ZTE, etc.<br>The outside world ridiculed that these “losers” formed the “Avenger alliance” in Xiaomi under the influence of Lei Jun.<br>Interestingly, Chang Cheng has the name of “magneto king” in the Jianghu. Before joining Xiaomi, he served as vice president of Lenovo Group and head of mobile phone business in China. He even often compared Lenovo’s mobile phone with Xiaomi’s mobile phone and said “fight against disobedience” on his microblog.<br>But no one expected that on the last day of 2019, Chang Cheng guanxuan left Lenovo and went to Xiaomi the next day to shake hands with Lei Jun’s “enemy” and become a “brother”. He served as vice president of Xiaomi group and was responsible for mobile phone product planning.<br>Chang Cheng’s “backwater” even triggered Lenovo’s non competition agreement. Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo Group, once said that for enterprises, the entry and exit of talents are very normal, and I hope these entry and exit are in line with the rules. “Whether it is import or export, we should respect the market competition rules and do not involve legal issues.”<br>In October 2020, Beijing Haidian District Labor and personnel dispute arbitration commission ruled that Chang Cheng would continue to perform the obligation of non competition, pay liquidated damages of RMB 525282100 for violation of non competition, and return the non competition compensation previously paid by Lenovo.<br>Since then, the parties have not spoken on this. Chang Cheng’s journey to Xiaomi doesn’t seem to be smooth.<br>Xiaomi 10 Youth Edition is the first product Chang Cheng is responsible for after joining Xiaomi. Before the product release, the publicity copy published by Chang Cheng on the microblog caused great controversy and was denounced as vulgar by netizens. Xiaomi group and Chang Cheng himself apologized successively, and Chang Cheng also donated 100000 yuan to youth education institutions.<br>Chang Cheng joined Xiaomi for half a year. Tencent Shenwang reported that Lei Jun was not satisfied with Chang Cheng because of the controversy caused by Chang Cheng’s publicity copy published on the microblog and the poor performance of the first show of Xiaomi 10 youth version.<br>Perhaps this has already laid the groundwork for Chang Cheng’s departure. From Li Weixing to Chang Cheng, Xiaomi stumbled into the next decade.</p>
<h3 id="02-byte-expansion"><a href="#02-byte-expansion" class="headerlink" title="02 byte expansion"></a>02 byte expansion</h3><p>In 2021, Zhou Shouzi left Lei Jun and joined Zhang Yiming.<br>For Zhou Weizi’s departure, Lei Jun said “there are all kinds of reluctance”. In 2015, when he hired Zhou Shouzi, who was only 32 at that time, to be Xiaomi CFO, many people complained. At that time, Xiaomi was in trouble and was making up lessons. Lei Jun needed someone who really knew finance and investment.<br>Previously, Zhou Shouzi invested in DST. As a Singaporean, he came to Beijing alone and successively completed the investment in Jingdong, Xiaomi, Ali, Didi, today’s headlines and other projects.<br>In Lei Jun’s view, Zhou Shouzi is young, smart and has a diligence of revenge on the world. He knows that Zhou Shouzi will meet with 350 entrepreneurs every year during his DST to study entrepreneurship projects and observe the development of China’s mobile Internet. Since 2010, he has been thinking about the core competitiveness of an enterprise every day.<br>Lei Jun is not mistaken. The book “forge ahead” records the working state of Zhou Weizi during Xiaomi’s IPO. “I’ve thought about every word in the prospectus several times,” Zhou said The prospectus of the H-share version of the HKEx has a full 600 pages.<br>In November 2019, Zhou Shouzi became president of Xiaomi’s international department and became one of Xiaomi’s new partners in August the next year. Lei Jun hoped that Zhou Shouzi could lead Xiaomi to accelerate its internationalization, but Zhou Shouzi chose byte beating, so that he could return to his hometown Singapore to work and turn from mobile phones to short video.<br>Zhou Shouzi and Zhang Yiming are old acquaintances. It was Zhou Shouzi who invested in today’s headlines on behalf of DST. “Byte beat: the secret from 0 to 1” recorded the scene of the two meeting.<br>After seeing Zhang Yiming, Zhou Weizi was very optimistic. He noticed the growth track of the application and thought that the founder Zhang Yiming was very capable and confident in the development direction of byte beating. Yuri Milner agreed to lead the round B financing. After the investment, he obtained a 7.2% stake, which is said to be worth $60 million. Today, even after dilution, these shares are still worth billions of dollars.<br>Zhou Shouzi<br>Zhou was funded to enter byte, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>“Zhou Shouzi is very familiar with our business, team and culture. He knew us during his work at DST and promoted DST to invest in us very early.”. Zhang Yiming said. As CEO of tiktok, Zhou Shouzi will be mainly responsible for corporate governance and long-term business planning.<br>Before taking over the investment this week, tiktok experienced a difficult time and was once banned in the United States. Kevin Mayer, former senior vice president of Disney, was invited to serve as byte coo and Global CEO of tiktok. Unexpectedly, Mayer left his post two months later. Later, with the new US leader taking office, the situation was alleviated.<br>At present, tiktok has more than 1 billion monthly live users. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of meta (former Facebook), said, “tiktok is a very large competitor, and it is growing at a very fast speed.
