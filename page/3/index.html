          <p>At the beginning of 2022, the new energy vehicle making force continues to make rapid progress, and the traditional automobile brands are still exploring in the transformation. However, market sales seem to prove that the market seems to have little time left for traditional brand exploration.<br>On February 14, Great Wall Motors (2333. HK) released the sales announcement in January. The data showed that the sales volume in January 2022 totaled 111800 vehicles, a year-on-year decrease of 19.59%. The next day, Great Wall Motor’s share price jumped 4.75% to HK $18.44, the lowest since May 2021.<br>Generally speaking, compared with the decline in sales at the end of the year, the decline in sales of automobile brands at the beginning of the year deserves more attention from the market, because some 4S stores often calculate the orders before the end of last year after the year, so as not to make the sales at the beginning of the year too ugly. On the other hand, January was the peak season of automobile sales in previous years. After all, many consumers took advantage of the new year to go home, I will rush to buy the car years ago, and the sales volume of all brands will not be poor.<br>From this perspective, the decline in sales of Great Wall Motors in January may be more worthy of market attention.</p>
<h3 id="The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line"><a href="#The-share-price-retreated-sharply-and-the-sales-growth-of-new-energy-vehicles-was-out-of-line" class="headerlink" title="The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line"></a>The share price retreated sharply, and the sales growth of new energy vehicles was out of line</h3><p>Judging from the trend of the capital market, the Great Wall stock price has entered a new round of decline. Since October last year, the Great Wall stock price has almost halved after falling from its high point. As of February 18, the share price of Great Wall Motors fell to 38. 25 yuan.<br>On the one hand, the capital market has entered the downward channel. On the other hand, from the storm of tank 300 delivery to the “core change door” of Euler good cat, and then to the recent shutdown of black cat and white cat, it seems that the transformation of the Great Wall is still a long way off.<br>2021 will be a year of ups and downs for the Great Wall. On the one hand, its 300 tanks, which mainly focus on small cross-country vehicles, have sold 84588 units, accounting for almost half of the domestic cross-country vehicles. On the other hand, as the production capacity of new vehicles is seriously lower than the market expectation, of course, lack of core is one of the important factors. As time goes by, the market enthusiasm dissipates, and the growth expectation in the future is declining.<br>Reflected in the capital market, under the haze of the epidemic, the share price of Great Wall Motors rose nearly tenfold from the peak in 2020 to 2021. By the end of 2021, the popularity of individual models was no longer, the capital market returned to rationality, and the high point of Great Wall stock price fell sharply.<br>There are generally two reasons for the decline of the high point of auto enterprises. One is the sharp decline in sales volume, and investors are bearish on the future growth of brand models. On the other hand, the overall market expectation decreases. For example, after the rise of Tesla, the market will inevitably make new adjustments to the valuation of traditional auto brands, because in the stock growth, the growth of new energy brands may correspond to the decline of traditional brands.<br>Overall, the withdrawal of the market value of the Great Wall shows that the expectations of the capital market are declining, and the shutdown of some of its new energy models may once again be bad for the growth momentum of the Great Wall in the new energy market.<br>On February 15, two new black cat and white cat models of Great Wall Motor’s brand Euler stopped accepting orders. Officials said that the two models were forced to stop production because of the shortage of chips, the supply of spare parts and the decline of new energy subsidies. Tianyancha app information shows that Euler brand was founded in 2001 and has experienced five rounds of financing.<br>In June last year, Great Wall Motors released its 2025 strategic target, which mentioned that the target sales volume was 4 million units, of which 80% were new energy vehicles, and the expected revenue was 600 billion.<br>From the sales ranking of new energy cars in January this year, the Great Wall’s brand Euler has only one Euler good cat in the top 10. In January, the sales volume of black cats reached 8612, while the sales volume of Euler black cats was only 3891. The sales volume of BYD Han, the third highest in the sales volume list, reached 12781, and the sales volume of Wuling macro mini, the first, was 26682.<br>With the rapid development of new forces, transformation is the top priority of traditional automobile brands. However, from the perspective of sales volume, the electric transformation of great wall seems to be out of step with the pace of the industry. The reason may be that the multi brand strategy of Great Wall Motors is not going smoothly under the burden of fuel vehicle brands.</p>
<h3 id="Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy"><a href="#Great-wall-motor-starts-the-“Shu-Road”-the-road-of-transformation-under-the-multi-brand-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy"></a>Great wall motor starts the “Shu Road”: the road of transformation under the multi brand strategy</h3><p>On the road of transformation, the Great Wall chose a “Shu Road”.<br>On the one hand, the wings of its new energy brand are not yet full, and the cash flow business that the group can rely on is still the fuel vehicle business. On the other hand, the market space of Harvard H6, the main sales force in the fuel vehicle market, is being squeezed by Geely, Chang’an and other competitors.<br>For example, in the traditional advantage SUV market of great wall, the models such as Xingyue l released by Geely in the past two years and cs75 under Chang’an have stronger product power. On the one hand, Haval’s response is to fight a price war with its competitors through the subdivision of H6 models. On the other hand, the VV series products under Wei brand have not opened a big gap in sales.<br>On the whole, facing the pressure of competitors step by step, Great Wall’s strategy seems to be to maintain the growth of fuel vehicle market through multi brand diversified expansion strategy.<br>An important reason supporting this decision is that the market demand has changed. On the one hand, with the automobile consumption track becoming a big red ocean track, but some segments of the track are still blue ocean market, such as the hard core cross-country track with a price range of 150000-250000 yuan. In fact, the success of the tank 300 is the success of the excavation subdivision.<br>In short, the change of consumers’ preferences promotes the further differentiation of market demand, resulting in the birth of a new blue ocean.<br>The popularity of tank 300 shows that there is no problem in the overall direction from large-scale accumulation to deep cultivation in market segments, which may also be the reason for the soaring share price of Great Wall in 2021. The retreat of the Great Wall stock price at the end of the year may be due to the potential problems found in the market.<br>There is no problem with the direction of market segmentation. The problem is that the brand front is too long.<br>From the perspective of brand positioning, Euler is more likely to be positioned as a fashion brand for young women, tanks are positioned as hardline cross-country, and Great Wall guns are positioned in the pickup truck market, focusing on villages and fourth and fifth tier cities.<br>If the brand front is too long, it will easily lead to the dispersion of resources. No matter in which market segment, once the market segment is verified, there will be competitors. Even if the segment track where Euler and tank are located is still the blue ocean market in the short term, the competitors will follow up quickly.<br>For example, in the field of hardline off-road, Chery’s brand jietu announced to officially enter this segment.<br>The launch of tank 300 is an important symbol of Great Wall Motor’s deep cultivation of market segments and high-end transformation. The popularity of the market highlights the problem of capacity climbing of tank 300. On the one hand, the production capacity is seriously disconnected from the short-term demand of the market and does not use the accumulation of brand reputation. On the other hand, when there are more and more players in the market segment, more and more resources will be required to be invested under competitive pressure. On the contrary, it will fall into long-term consumption, which will affect the profits of the group.<br>For example, Harvard H6 sales declined in 2017, followed by the launch of the red and blue standard Haval H6 coupe and the new Haval H6, and the number of models increased to 55. Under the market competition, 2018q3 Haval officially announced that Haval’s best-selling models were fully preferential, resulting in a sharp decline in profits in the quarter.<br>In the long run, a negative result of the multi brand front is that the resources of the group’s electric transformation may be further dispersed.<br>In fact, looking back at the development process of auto giants such as Ford and Volkswagen, it is not difficult to find that they have also experienced rapid brand expansion. Later, facts have proved that too many fronts are not conducive to the growth of the overall business. In the follow-up development, the waste of resources is increasing due to too many brands, and consumers’ brand cognition is further dispersed.<br>As a result, Volkswagen and Ford began to shrink their product lines again to further improve product efficiency. Later, Volkswagen launched the MQB platform and moved towards the route of intensive growth.<br>In fact, the Great Wall brand models have an obvious feature, that is, the popularity of new cars is very high, but there are not many hard power products that can really stand the test of time.<br>For great wall, H6 model is one of the few models that have been tested for a long time, which gives great wall the opportunity to launch brand-new Wei brand, tank, Euler and other follow-up brands and deeply cultivate the market segments. How much trial and error space the traditional fuel vehicle market can bring to the transformation of new energy may be a question that needs to be considered.</p>
<h3 id="Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments"><a href="#Great-Wall-transformation-dilemma-it-is-difficult-to-fully-scale-the-market-segments" class="headerlink" title="Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments"></a>Great Wall transformation dilemma: it is difficult to fully scale the market segments</h3><p>A practical problem is that with the continuous growth of the new energy vehicle market, the transformation time of traditional brands is shortening.<br>Under the double score policy, the performance of new energy vehicles will directly affect the growth of the overall business of the brand group. On the other hand, with the introduction of fuel vehicle sales schedules all over the world, traditional brands urgently need new energy to open up new large-scale growth.<br>The transformation road of great wall new energy seems to be still long.<br>In addition to the expected future growth, the quality problem of Euler brand models is also the threshold that Great Wall Motors must cross in its transformation.<br>According to the statistics of vehicle quality network, from December to February 19, 2021, the quality complaints about Euler’s good cat ranked first. In addition to the publicity problems, there are also some problems such as body accessories and electrical appliances. In addition, there are a series of problems such as video and audio faults, on-board interconnection faults and so on.<br>From the distribution of product problems, the complaints about Euler on the vehicle quality online also seem to reflect the maladjustment of Great Wall Motors on the road of transforming new energy. If this does not adapt to the long-term, it may affect the long-term growth of Euler brand.<br>User reputation is the first vitality. Product quality problems can have a far-reaching impact on the accumulation of brand reputation and long-term sales growth.<br>For example, the reputation of German brands has declined in the past two years, while the reputation and sales volume of Japanese brands are increasing. To a certain extent, this is the long-term impact caused by product quality differences. As far as the Great Wall is concerned, this point deserves vigilance.<br>The most important thing in the transformation of traditional automobile brands to new energy is scale.<br>Why can Tesla succeed? Not because of how amazing Tesla Model s is. Instead, model 3 completed the rapid scale of the new energy market in a short time through price reduction.<br>Some domestic manufacturers are aware of this. For example, SAIC launched Wuling Hongguang Mini. On the one hand, the substantial growth of sales volume has brought a lot of points to fuel vehicles. On the other hand, in this process, they unknowingly completed the brand transformation, laying the groundwork for Wuling brand to launch electric products in the future.<br>A reality that great wall has to face is that the Euler brand with gender preference may be difficult to lay the foundation for long-term market growth through effective scale.<br>From the perspective of market strategy, for automobile brands, the women’s market is a blue ocean market after hardline off-road, but one thing that can not be ignored is that the main force of the current automobile consumption market is, on the one hand, the family as the unit, on the other hand, the market consumer group is still the male group.<br>Great Wall’s biggest weakness in positioning the Euler brand may be that the overly obvious gender label naturally rejects the mainstream car owners.<br>In other words, even if the good cat and other models under the Euler brand can sell more than 10000 vehicles per model, its brand influence and reputation may be far less capable of driving sales than the new energy brands of other fuel vehicle manufacturers. From this perspective, entering the new energy market with Euler as the main position may pave the way for the long-term growth of the brand in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Write-at-the-end"><a href="#Write-at-the-end" class="headerlink" title="Write at the end:"></a>Write at the end:</h3><p>The transformation of traditional automobile manufacturers into new energy requires not only changing products, but also changing thinking.<br>The strategy of multi brand expansion of Great Wall Motor’s segment market can indeed meet the consumers of the segment market and enjoy the blue ocean dividend of the segment market in the early stage. However, in order to tap these segments for a long time, it needs a higher product power moat, and the sustainability of the product life cycle may be limited, resulting in a waste of resources.<br>In the long run, this is not conducive to the transformation and development of the whole Great Wall group. Next, how to capture the eyes of capital and realize the scale of new energy business more efficiently may still be a problem that needs in-depth reflection for the Great Wall.<br>This article is from WeChat public No. ID:IPOxscj, the author of the 36 official account of the company.</p>

          <p>According to techcrunch, Congo based start-up Jambo recently announced that it had raised $7.5 million in seed funds, including coinbase ventures, 3aC, Alameda research, tiger global, Delphi ventures, alliancedao, defiance capital, yield guild games, polygon studios, and some angel investors from Web3 ecosystem, For example, Sandeep nailwal, co-founder and CEO of polygon, Santiago r Santos, former parafi partner, do Kwon, co-founder and CEO of terrain labs and partners of Delphi digital piers kicks participated in this round of investment.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>The start-up company “Jambo” was founded in November 2021. They are committed to building “Web3 super application” in Africa and obtain income opportunities through the logic of “learning, playing and making money”. Some experts said that Southeast Asia has become one of the best markets of Web3, and Africa is about to be overturned by Web3. Startups such as axie infinity and yield guild games are located in Southeast Asia and have raised millions of dollars in venture capital. The combination of rapid population growth, stable smartphone penetration, increased adoption of cryptocurrency, low per capita GDP and high unemployment makes Africa the next mature place of Web3.<br>James Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Jambo, said that Jambo hopes to add millions of users to Web3 in Africa through its application. Similar to axie infinity and other guilds, users can only earn income when playing games in revenue sharing mode, while “Jambo” adopts a two-way approach, allowing its users to earn income when participating in web2 and Web3 activities.<br>For example, users can save data expenses when using “Jambo”. James Zhang explained that “Jambo” can get a discount of nearly 70% in cooperation with telecom suppliers and sell it directly to users at a discount of 50% of the original cost. “This is one of our main user acquisition strategies. We hope to double the call time and data of each African.”<br>Second, “Jambo” is working with social media companies, so users can earn tokens when viewing their content on their apps, which can be converted into cash income. “By working with these social media companies, we tokenize part of their advertising budget and provide it directly to end users,” James Zhang said.<br>In addition, James Zhang said that at present, there are no Web3 games from Africa that make money through games because of the lack of certain infrastructure. Jambo wants to build such infrastructure. Nevertheless, “Jambo” does not intend to take a share of users’ income. Instead, Jambo’s revenue will come from the web2 model - charging advertising fees and commissions by selling call time and data.<br>As the “gateway to Web3 in Africa”, James Zhang said that Jambo will test more than 10 games in the coming months to introduce its operation to users. “Education is at the heart of our work, because I don’t think there is a shortcut in Africa. You have to educate the user base before you can consider making a profit at the end of the day or start acquiring users again, which is why we launch education courses on Web3,” he said.<br>The picture is from the official website<br>“Every component in our super app is actually designed to help ordinary people make money, such as watching videos to make money and save data expenses. So ideally, within three to six months after our app goes online, ordinary people can make $50 a month by playing axie infinity and another $20 a month by watching videos.”<br>“Jambo” is expected to release its beta version in the second quarter and officially launch in the third quarter. “What wechat has done in China,” Jambo “will also do in Africa. We are also pleased to support this a + team to become a Web3 super application on the African continent,” Web3 investor and former parafi partner Santiago r Santos said in a statement.</p>

          <p>Wen Silai yuan<br>Editor Su Jianxun<br>On February 21, Huawei released the latest wireless product solutions, mainly for operators, providing TDD third-generation massive MIMO products and FDD ultra wideband multi antenna series.<br>The so-called TDD (time division duplex) and FDD (frequency division duplex) refer to different information transmission modes. Huawei’s products released this time cover two modes, which will cooperate and eventually move towards “multiple frequencies and one network”.<br>Compared with the past, the third generation products can be configured with lower transmission power, reduce energy consumption by about 30%, and have a wider coverage. On the other hand, compared with the second generation products, the antenna array is nearly twice as many and the signal is stronger. The commercial FDD massive MIMO released by Huawei this time can increase the 4G network capacity by three times. If it is upgraded to 5g, the capacity can be increased by five times.<br>They also launched corresponding solutions for residential areas, urban hotspots and other scenes, which can be deployed by operators in a minimalist manner. This is also the only distributed m-mimo (large-scale multiple input and output technology) in the industry. Compared with 4t4r (four transmitting antennas and four receiving antennas), this scheme has a four times increase in network capacity, mainly for the demand of 5g in indoor scenes such as railway stations and shopping malls.<br>Operators have always wanted to have more products with large bandwidth and multiple antennas. Huawei has always been the industry leader in this technology. For a long time, mobile phones accounted for the majority of Huawei’s revenue. Now, operators and enterprise businesses will become the main body again.<br>According to Huawei’s financial report for the first half of 2021, in the first half of last year, Huawei’s consumer business fell 47% year-on-year, operator business fell 14.2% year-on-year, and enterprise business including Huawei cloud increased 18.2% year-on-year. It can be expected that compared with the steep decline of consumer business, operator business and enterprise business will become the key in the future.<br>Of course, the business of Huawei operators is also under pressure. Huawei 5g equipment has been abandoned in Europe. However, compared with mobile phone business, the decline of operator business will be relatively slow.<br>However, Huawei obviously continues to invest in 5g technology research and development. The products released this time also represent that Huawei will not give up 5g dividends. The next generation communication network is far from universal. At this time window, Huawei also hopes to build a deeper moat.</p>

          <p>No one can’t live without an iron boss or a flowing executive.<br>Even the brothers who started a business after drinking millet porridge with Lei Jun are leaving one after another. The nearest one is Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12.<br>Before leaving office, he served as vice chairman and Secretary General of Xiaomi Technical Committee and was one of the earliest founding team members of Xiaomi. Even, he once showed his love in an interview with the media, “I just married Xiaomi.”<br>Before Li Weixing, Lei Jun just sent off Chang Cheng, vice president of the company and general manager of Xiaomi mobile phone products department at the end of January 2022. Chang Cheng comes from Lenovo and is one of the members of Lei Jun’s “Avenger alliance”.<br>Before Chang Cheng, Lei Jun bid farewell to Zhou Shouzi, President of Xiaomi International Department, who made great contributions to Xiaomi’s investment and listing. After leaving Xiaomi, Zhou Shouzi switched to Zhang Yiming’s command, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>Seeing off the brothers one after another was Liu qiangdong.<br>A few months ago, Zhou Bowen, chairman of Jingdong Technical Committee and President of Jingdong Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Xu Ling, head of the group’s Strategy Department known as the “father of IOUS” of Jingdong, and Xiao Jun, vice president of Jingdong group and President of X business unit, left successively.<br>For Liu qiangdong, this may have been commonplace. There have been too many executives coming in and out of Jingdong in recent years. Jingdong has transported many management talents for the retail and fresh food industries. A few years ago, Lei Jun also said, “no veterans, no inheritance. No recruits, no future.”<br>Of course, the resignation of senior executives is an ordinary thing, but it is not necessarily simple behind the ordinary. Generally speaking, they either leave for personal or family reasons, or have a better place to go, or they are forced to leave because they can’t satisfy their boss. But this is also a window to observe a company, so that we can see its development status, strategic changes, future direction, etc.<br>People are the opposite of the company.</p>
<h3 id="01-Xiaomi-transition"><a href="#01-Xiaomi-transition" class="headerlink" title="01 Xiaomi transition"></a>01 Xiaomi transition</h3><p>Xiaomi confirmed to the media that Li Weixing has indeed left and wants to return to his hometown in Guangzhou.<br>Li Weixing, who grew up in Guangzhou and studied computer science at Sun Yat sen University, first joined Microsoft in 2005 to be responsible for the research and development of windows phone camera software. In 2009, Lin bin, who was at Google, was ready to start a business with Lei Jun, so he introduced his little alumni Li Weixing to Lei Jun.<br>According to Li Weixing’s memory, Lei Jun talked with him for several hours, talked about some things he had done and was doing, talked about the current situation of the mobile phone industry, his views on smart phones, the goal of making Xiaomi mobile phones, etc. “It’s mutual understanding.”<br>Lei Jun also revealed that he met more than 100 people in three months at that time. The opening remarks are always about who I am, what I have done and who I want to find. Can you give me a chance to meet and talk.<br>To a certain extent, Li Weixing saw that Lei Jun still had a halo and decided to join in a few days later.<br>First from the left: Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12<br>In the early days, Li Weixing was responsible for the development of MIUI in Xiaomi. Even, he didn’t have much expectations for Xiaomi and Lei Jun. According to the Mars laboratory, Li Weixing believed only one tenth of Lei Jun’s first big cake for Xiaomi. “At that time, the expectation was not so high, but it was very satisfied to achieve the effect of big cake.”.<br>After Xiaomi went public in 2018, Lei Jun made a large-scale organizational structure adjustment, and Li Weixing emerged as a young man.<br>Lei Jun set up four new Internet business departments, and Li Weixing became the general manager of Internet Department 1, reporting directly to Lei Jun. Internet department I is composed of some departments of MIUI and some departments of Xiaomi mutual Entertainment Department, which is responsible for MIUI core experience, technology middle stage, commercial product R &amp; D and advertising sales, game distribution, business cooperation and MIUI international business.<br>Lei Jun explained, “we must hand over the front-line business position to young people, so that young talents can emerge and make achievements like in the early stage of entrepreneurship. We must constantly integrate fresh blood, so as to have a long-term mechanism for talent echelon handover.”<br>Only six months later, Li Weixing was transferred to the fourth Internet department as general manager. In 2020, Xiaomi Internet business department was integrated again, and Li Weixing was transferred to Xiaomi Technical Committee until he left.<br>In fact, after Xiaomi appeared on the market, Lei Jun realized that his past playing style was a bit like guerrillas or special teams, which created many miracles and trained a number of excellent cadres. However, we can’t rely on guerrilla warfare next. We should be able to fight mobile warfare, stalemate warfare and even large regiments.<br>Therefore, in addition to Li Weixing, the young people who grew up inside Xiaomi, they need to introduce a large number of talents from the outside.<br>With the idea of being high-end and competing with apple, Lei Jun introduced a number of executives who had worked in other mobile phone brands around 2020, such as Chang Cheng from Lenovo, Lu Weibing from Jinli, Miao Lei from Nubia, Wang Xiaoyan from chili, Yang zhe from Huawei, Zeng Xuezhong from ZTE, etc.<br>The outside world ridiculed that these “losers” formed the “Avenger alliance” in Xiaomi under the influence of Lei Jun.<br>Interestingly, Chang Cheng has the name of “magneto king” in the Jianghu. Before joining Xiaomi, he served as vice president of Lenovo Group and head of mobile phone business in China. He even often compared Lenovo’s mobile phone with Xiaomi’s mobile phone and said “fight against disobedience” on his microblog.<br>But no one expected that on the last day of 2019, Chang Cheng guanxuan left Lenovo and went to Xiaomi the next day to shake hands with Lei Jun’s “enemy” and become a “brother”. He served as vice president of Xiaomi group and was responsible for mobile phone product planning.<br>Chang Cheng’s “backwater” even triggered Lenovo’s non competition agreement. Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo Group, once said that for enterprises, the entry and exit of talents are very normal, and I hope these entry and exit are in line with the rules. “Whether it is import or export, we should respect the market competition rules and do not involve legal issues.”<br>In October 2020, Beijing Haidian District Labor and personnel dispute arbitration commission ruled that Chang Cheng would continue to perform the obligation of non competition, pay liquidated damages of RMB 525282100 for violation of non competition, and return the non competition compensation previously paid by Lenovo.<br>Since then, the parties have not spoken on this. Chang Cheng’s journey to Xiaomi doesn’t seem to be smooth.<br>Xiaomi 10 Youth Edition is the first product Chang Cheng is responsible for after joining Xiaomi. Before the product release, the publicity copy published by Chang Cheng on the microblog caused great controversy and was denounced as vulgar by netizens. Xiaomi group and Chang Cheng himself apologized successively, and Chang Cheng also donated 100000 yuan to youth education institutions.<br>Chang Cheng joined Xiaomi for half a year. Tencent Shenwang reported that Lei Jun was not satisfied with Chang Cheng because of the controversy caused by Chang Cheng’s publicity copy published on the microblog and the poor performance of the first show of Xiaomi 10 youth version.<br>Perhaps this has already laid the groundwork for Chang Cheng’s departure. From Li Weixing to Chang Cheng, Xiaomi stumbled into the next decade.</p>
<h3 id="02-byte-expansion"><a href="#02-byte-expansion" class="headerlink" title="02 byte expansion"></a>02 byte expansion</h3><p>In 2021, Zhou Shouzi left Lei Jun and joined Zhang Yiming.<br>For Zhou Weizi’s departure, Lei Jun said “there are all kinds of reluctance”. In 2015, when he hired Zhou Shouzi, who was only 32 at that time, to be Xiaomi CFO, many people complained. At that time, Xiaomi was in trouble and was making up lessons. Lei Jun needed someone who really knew finance and investment.<br>Previously, Zhou Shouzi invested in DST. As a Singaporean, he came to Beijing alone and successively completed the investment in Jingdong, Xiaomi, Ali, Didi, today’s headlines and other projects.<br>In Lei Jun’s view, Zhou Shouzi is young, smart and has a diligence of revenge on the world. He knows that Zhou Shouzi will meet with 350 entrepreneurs every year during his DST to study entrepreneurship projects and observe the development of China’s mobile Internet. Since 2010, he has been thinking about the core competitiveness of an enterprise every day.<br>Lei Jun is not mistaken. The book “forge ahead” records the working state of Zhou Weizi during Xiaomi’s IPO. “I’ve thought about every word in the prospectus several times,” Zhou said The prospectus of the H-share version of the HKEx has a full 600 pages.<br>In November 2019, Zhou Shouzi became president of Xiaomi’s international department and became one of Xiaomi’s new partners in August the next year. Lei Jun hoped that Zhou Shouzi could lead Xiaomi to accelerate its internationalization, but Zhou Shouzi chose byte beating, so that he could return to his hometown Singapore to work and turn from mobile phones to short video.<br>Zhou Shouzi and Zhang Yiming are old acquaintances. It was Zhou Shouzi who invested in today’s headlines on behalf of DST. “Byte beat: the secret from 0 to 1” recorded the scene of the two meeting.<br>After seeing Zhang Yiming, Zhou Weizi was very optimistic. He noticed the growth track of the application and thought that the founder Zhang Yiming was very capable and confident in the development direction of byte beating. Yuri Milner agreed to lead the round B financing. After the investment, he obtained a 7.2% stake, which is said to be worth $60 million. Today, even after dilution, these shares are still worth billions of dollars.<br>Zhou Shouzi<br>Zhou was funded to enter byte, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>“Zhou Shouzi is very familiar with our business, team and culture. He knew us during his work at DST and promoted DST to invest in us very early.”. Zhang Yiming said. As CEO of tiktok, Zhou Shouzi will be mainly responsible for corporate governance and long-term business planning.<br>Before taking over the investment this week, tiktok experienced a difficult time and was once banned in the United States. Kevin Mayer, former senior vice president of Disney, was invited to serve as byte coo and Global CEO of tiktok. Unexpectedly, Mayer left his post two months later. Later, with the new US leader taking office, the situation was alleviated.<br>At present, tiktok has more than 1 billion monthly live users. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of meta (former Facebook), said, “tiktok is a very large competitor, and it is growing at a very fast speed. Although we have very fast development, our competitors are also growing rapidly.”<br>In the future, if tiktok is listed, Zhou’s investment can be described as “professional counterpart”.<br>Now tiktok is from music in 2018 Ly merged with the original tiktok, after byte bought music for $1 billion a year Ly, it is said that Facebook was also interested in bidding at that time.<br>Speaking of this, it is necessary to mention Liu Zhen, senior vice president in charge of byte internationalization at that time. Liu Zhen has worked as a lawyer in Silicon Valley for nearly ten years. She is known to the outside world because she launched a “taxi war” with her cousin didi president Liu Qing.<br>In August 2015, Liu Zhen became the head of Uber China strategy. According to the data at that time, in her first year in office, Uber China carried out business in 60 cities, with more than 500 employees nationwide, and the market share increased from about 2% at the beginning of 2015 to about 30%.<br>However, on August 1, 2016, Didi travel and Uber China announced their merger. According to the report of people, the people who were extremely sad after the merger also included Liu Zhen. Her expression was stiff and her voice was dumb. It can be seen that she “cried many times”.<br>Two months later, Liu Zhen joined today’s headlines. Then the latter accelerated its internationalization and successively acquired flipagram and music ly。 When talking about the acquisition at that time, Liu Zhen said it was a process of mutual trust. “We can see the potential of products and talents. We are not simply investing, but really understanding the industry technology to help their development.”<br>Liu Zhen said that she was impressed by Zhang Yiming’s ambition and that he was able to accommodate talents from multiple cultural backgrounds, which is why she joined. Over time, Liu Zhen’s authority in byte has become smaller and smaller. It is said that after Kevin Mayer joined, she was only responsible for domestic legal affairs.<br>In May 2020, Liu Zhen left byte and joined Yuanqi forest to be responsible for overseas business.<br>Expanding bytes, constantly looking for more suitable people.</p>
<h3 id="03-Jingdong-aftershock"><a href="#03-Jingdong-aftershock" class="headerlink" title="03 Jingdong aftershock"></a>03 Jingdong aftershock</h3><p>In November 2021, almost within a week, JD was exposed that Xu Ling, Zhou Bowen and Xiao Jun had resigned.<br>To some extent, this is the aftershock after the disintegration of Jingdong “troika”. In recent years, Liu qiangdong has retreated behind the scenes. Xu Lei, Chen Shengqiang and Wang Zhenhui, the former top leaders of JD retail, JD digital and JD logistics, have formed a “troika” and are active in front of the stage.<br>But at the end of 2020, the “troika” was suddenly broken up.<br>First, Chen Shengqiang was appointed Vice Chairman of Jingdong digital division and chief of staff of Jingdong group, and Li Yayun, chief compliance officer of Jingdong group, served as CEO of Jingdong digital division; More than a week later, Wang Zhenhui resigned and Yu Rui, JD’s chief human resources officer, was appointed the new CEO of JD logistics; In September 2021, Xu Lei became president of JD group, and Xin Lijun, former CEO of JD health, took over JD retail.<br>In terms of the company structure, Xu Lei is responsible for the daily operation and coordinated development of various business sectors and reports to Liu qiangdong, who will devote more time to long-term strategic design, young CEO training and Rural Revitalization.<br>In May 2021, Yu Rui led JD logistics to list in Hong Kong. Jingdong Digital Technology Co., Ltd. was listed and stranded, merged with Jingdong cloud and AI business, and renamed Jingdong technology. It is reported that it wants to IPO again.<br>Xu Ling is from Jingdong digital science and Xiao Jun is from Jingdong Logistics. Zhou Bowen previously led the cloud and AI business. After the disintegration of the “troika”, the three people were more or less affected at the business level.<br>Xu Ling worked in the headquarters of many banks, joined jd.com in 2013, and later participated in the establishment of jd.com together with Chen Shengqiang. Xu Ling led the team to launch Jingdong’s “white note”, “Beijing Agricultural Loan” and other financial products. After Jingdong finance transformed into Jingdong digital section, it integrated the original personal services and enterprise services, set up a digital finance group, and Xu Ling served as the person in charge.<br>Three months after Chen Shengqiang left office, Xu Ling was transferred to the CSO system of JD group as the head of the strategic planning department and reported to Liao Jianwen, the CSO (Chief Strategic Officer) of JD group, who is responsible for strategy and investment. In July, Liao Jianwen retired due to physical reasons. The CSO system strategy department was renamed the strategy Department of JD group, which was in the charge of Xu Ling and reported to Liu qiangdong. Other departments of CSO system are also adjusted.<br>After leaving office, Xu Ling sent a wechat circle of friends saying, “I have always regarded curiosity and courage as my life creed, but from these experiences during this period, I found that there is a great lack. Curiosity and courage are both doing more and will be unbalanced. I should add another one to myself. I chose reconciliation, which is more rational, thinking and letting go.”<br>In February 2017, Liu qiangdong said at the 2017 annual meeting of JD group that in the second 12 years, he hoped to transform all the business models established by JD in the first 12 years into a pure technology company.<br>Qiang Dong Liu<br>Liu qiangdong began to attract technical talents in many ways. In September of that year, Zhou Bowen joined JD and became the vice president of JD group. He was responsible for the relevant business of JD AI research and Platform Department and reported to Liu qiangdong.<br>Previously, Zhou Bowen worked at IBM’s headquarters in New York, served as the president of IBM research artificial intelligence Basic Research Institute, chief scientist of IBM Watson group and IBM outstanding engineer, and was responsible for IBM’s global strategy and implementation of basic research in artificial intelligence and deep learning.<br>In December 2019, jd.com set up a cloud and AI business department to integrate the three business departments of jd.com cloud, artificial intelligence and IOT. Zhou Bowen was responsible for reporting to Liu qiangdong. At the same time, a technical committee was established, with Zhou Bowen as the chairman.<br>With the establishment of Jingdong technology, Zhou Bowen’s scope of authority has been reduced. According to 36 krypton, Zhou Bowen wants to do something big, such as listing his business. After the merger, although his position is attached to the CEO of JD technology, he has no real job. After leaving Jingdong, Zhou Bowen will start a business in AI direction.<br>Among the three, Xiao Jun has been in Jingdong for the longest time. He joined in 2007 and participated in the design of Jingdong’s early front-end website and supply chain system. After that, X business unit, which was responsible for it, tried to build a set of intelligent warehousing and logistics system, including unmanned warehouse, UAV, unmanned car, unmanned supermarket, etc.<br>For example, for UAVs, Xiao Jun once told me, “the requirement of president Liu (Liu qiangdong) is that the cost center should turn to the profit center, that is, you can spend money without restriction and make money in the future.”<br>Compared with Xu Ling and Zhou Bowen, some people in Jingdong also felt that Xiao Jun left suddenly without any sign.<br>After the disintegration of the “troika”, some people left and some came up. Jingdong is forming a new management structure and governance system, and the real trader is still Liu qiangdong.<br>This is the case with the company, the iron boss and the flowing executive.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:value_creation, and is published by Guo Zhaofei, 36 krypton.</p>
