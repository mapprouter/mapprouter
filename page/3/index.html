<ol>
<li>China’s music therapy industry is getting more attention, which is related to the social background of about 54 million people suffering from depression and about 41 million people suffering from anxiety disorder.</li>
<li>The music healing industry has diversified manifestations. Not only is the offline Songbo music hot, but also platforms such as Himalaya and cool dog have entered the market. At the same time, there are also a large number of music content creators.</li>
<li>Behind the music therapy industry is the basic logic of music therapy, which has gone from theory to the public.</li>
<li>To become a music therapist, there must be professional and professional regulations, but beyond this specific concept, everyone can apply music to life for self adjustment.<br>“What do you like about this song?” Gao Tian asked the visitor.<br>“I don’t know English, so I don’t know what to sing inside, but I think it sounds good. I think this song is very kind and kind.”<br>When Gao Tian asked about the relationship between the visitor and his father, the visitor was stunned at first. He didn’t speak for a long time, and then his tears came down. The visitor said, “in my memory, I don’t remember that my father once held himself and never got fatherly love.”<br>This is an ordinary music therapy scene. Gao Tian, the founder of the domestic music therapy discipline, told the little antler music finance. “In music therapy, it is said that a person likes a song or a piece of music for no reason. It is purely pleasant to hear. It must have something to do with his own unique life experience or the needs of the emotional world.”<br>The healing function of music is a new way of punk health preservation for a generation, which is related to the current general state of the public.<br>According to the sample survey of residents in 16 cities with a population of more than one million conducted by China Health Association in 2021, the proportion of sub-health in China has reached more than 70%, and the population in sub-health status has reached about 700 million, showing an upward trend. According to who statistics, about 54 million people in China suffer from depression and about 41 million people suffer from anxiety disorders.<br>Meanwhile, according to the survey data of China Sleep Research Association, the incidence of insomnia in Chinese adults is 38.2%, and nearly 300 million people may need sleep services such as sound therapy.<br>The 2021 white paper on Chinese scene music users released by airy consulting reveals that the principle of music therapy is actually the basic logic behind healing music.<br>So how does music therapy develop? Will music therapy guided by it be the next outlet?<h3 id="Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines"><a href="#Music-therapy-based-on-professional-disciplines" class="headerlink" title="Music therapy based on professional disciplines"></a>Music therapy based on professional disciplines</h3>Although the first Chinese medical book, Huangdi Neijing, discusses in detail the relationship between people’s heart, liver, spleen, lung and stomach and the five tone palace Shang Jiao Yu, and puts forward the theory that “there are five internal organs to respond to the five tones”, “happy and sad, angry hurt the liver, excellent hurt the lung, think about hurting the swelling and fear hurting the arm. Therefore, the musician moves the blood circulation, spirit and right heart”, But music therapy officially became a professional discipline at the University of Casas in 1940.<br>After more than half a century of development, the scope of work of music therapists has covered many fields, such as psychology, rehabilitation, anesthesia, childbirth, hospice care, cancer rehabilitation, hospital living environment, pain control, physical and mental disease maintenance and so on.<br>In 1988, China Conservatory of music established a junior college class of music therapy, taught by Zhang Hongyi. Although due to teachers and other reasons, this major will be closed soon. But this master class opened the way for the professional development of music therapy. In 1997, under the leadership of Gao Tian, the Central Conservatory of music systematically introduced the discipline of music therapy and established the research center of music therapy. Then, the professional education of music therapy in China rose one after another.<br>However, in terms of public cognition and acceptance, music therapy is still “minority”, and this major first came into public view after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008.<br>At that time, Gao Tian led a team to the disaster area to carry out music therapy activities. In November of the same year, Gao Tian was invited to attend the annual meeting of American music therapy and delivered a speech on “music therapy crisis intervention in China’s Sichuan earthquake”, which caused a sensation in the American music therapy industry. This speech also enabled the practice of Chinese music therapy to gradually step onto the international stage.<br>In addition to discipline construction, social vocational education of music therapists is also in full bloom. Gaotian music mental health research center, China Commercial Enterprise Association, music medicine and technical equipment branch of China Medical Equipment Association and other social organizations have provided certification training courses for music therapists, and “hindmet” practical music (Chengdu hindmet Culture Communication Co., Ltd.) has also provided brand certification training for gebmusik music therapists.<br>In 2014, after many efforts, China business enterprise management association approved the establishment of the music therapist Industry Committee of China business enterprise management association. Gao Tian, Zhao Xin, Liu Mingming, Wang Bing, Liu Lichun, Zhou Ping, Wang Lujie, Zhang Xiaoying and a group of practitioners from various universities, 100 million yuan and rehabilitation centers formed a supervisor group.<br>What develops in the same way as education is practice. However, in terms of the chronological development order of music therapy in China, music physiotherapy precedes music therapy. In the late 1970s, the physiotherapy departments of some hospitals began to use music electrotherapy, including music electrotherapy and music electroacupuncture. Later, there were successively music light frequency therapy, music guidance (Music qigong) and other treatment methods.<br>In September 1984, Mawangdui sanatorium established the first psychomusic treatment room in China. From 1985 to 1986, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital and Beijing Anding Hospital cooperated with music professionals to carry out scientific research on active music therapy for senile depression and operational music therapy for chronic schizophrenia.<br>In 1991, Beijing Huilongguan Hospital established a music treatment room in the behavior treatment area, which is also the first hospital to establish a music treatment room in the national psychiatric hospital, and created a new treatment model for the rehabilitation of mental patients.<br>During the municipal government covid-19, COVID-19 and the provincial and municipal governments attached great importance to the psychological assistance of new crowns infected with pneumonia, close contacts, front-line workers and difficult people. They issued a number of psychological aid policies and measures, and asked for continuous psychological counseling, emotional support and psychological crisis intervention.<br>Beijing Huilongguan Hospital has set up a psychological rescue medical team to provide targeted and effective psychological decompression and relaxation methods for front-line medical staff in the fight against the epidemic, including music therapy. In addition, various institutions, colleges and individual music therapists in the field of music therapy have responded to the call and contributed to the cause of psychological assistance.<br>For example, Professor Wan Ying, a professor at Wuhan Conservatory of Music, led the team to start the music therapy radio, and sent two music decompression and relaxation music packages to the public through the WeChat official account. Zhang Ren, a distinguished expert from the research center of personality and social psychology of Peking University, dredged the panic psychology of the people in the form of online micro courses, and gave guidance to the medical staff in the epidemic area on music therapy technology.<br>Gao Tian, who has retired from the Central Conservatory of music, has established a “music therapy online psychological assistance hotline platform”, which solves the obstacles of face-to-face consultation technology caused by the epidemic through remote means such as ear worms, mer trauma treatment technology and music safety island, so as to carry out psychological intervention. Wen Yun and Shi Jingjie in Guangzhou jointly launched the “home music self-care action” with other music therapists, using music to provide emotional regulation and relief for residents in the sealed area.<br>Strictly speaking, home music self-care cannot be regarded as the category of music therapy.<br>In October 2021, Gao Tian also mentioned in the academic lecture “Reflection on the development of music therapy in China and Thinking on Postmodern music psychotherapy” that the boundary between music therapy and “music entertainment” is vague, which can not reflect the uniqueness, professionalism and technicality of music therapy. Therapists must prove the medical and social value of this profession in the clinical process in order to make the public recognize music therapy as a systematic science.<br>However, music therapist Wen Yun said that music self-care is a set of public oriented methods based on “music guided imagination” in music therapy, which can spread the concept of music therapy to more people.<br>In order to make the public better understand the significance of music therapy, Zhang Ren, who has long been engaged in music therapy and clinical psychological research in the field of adolescent emotional intervention and marginal criminal behavior intervention, wrote the musical psychological drama addictive people. Different from the previous dramas promoting drug addiction and Internet addiction, the play does not blindly emphasize the serious harm of these addictions, but discusses the environmental and psychological factors of the formation of these addictions.<br>In November 2021, the third annual academic conference of the World League music therapy Specialized Committee was held in Shanghai. The topics of music therapy and music therapy, the quality standard for training professionals in music therapy, and the construction of first-rate professional were discussed in the era of music therapy and Chinese medicine, COVID-19 and post epidemic Era.<br>With the development of music therapy, the healing music industry came into being.<h3 id="Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period"><a href="#Music-healing-industry-in-the-exploratory-period" class="headerlink" title="Music healing industry in the exploratory period"></a>Music healing industry in the exploratory period</h3>According to the public data of Himalaya, in 2020, more than 83 million people listened to healing music in Himalaya, and the average consumption amount of music paying users reached 76 yuan. From 2018 to 2020, the number of healing music listeners increased by 302%.<br>By 2021, according to the white paper on Chinese scene music users in 2021 released by iResearch, the vast majority of users of healing scenes prefer soothing and decompressing music, accounting for 83.7%, and the user stickiness is high. The cumulative proportion of listening to healing scene music once a day and above is as high as 57.5%. In addition, in terms of the single listening time of users, users in the healing scene will listen for more than 1 to 2 hours at a time. In addition, many users will listen for more than 3 hours at a time.<br>In terms of willingness to pay, more users are willing to pay for soothing and decompressing music and lonely healing music. The cumulative willingness to pay for these two music forms is 82.4% and 80.7% respectively, of which users aged 26 to 30 have the highest willingness to pay. Among the types of soothing and decompressing music, users aged 31 to 35 and 41 to 45 also pay a relatively high proportion, reaching 56.1% and 50% respectively.<br>In 2021, kugou cooperated with the ear circle to launch “delta brain wave 3D immersive sleep aid music”, and worked with the medical team and psychological institutions to create a “healing zone”, including the music for the scene of pregnancy and childbirth based on the social environment with a probability of depression of up to 43%.<br>As a team focusing on situational auditory content production and technology research and development, ear circle is also the top blogger of healing music in the Himalayas. According to the ear team, the production of healing music must be based on early experiments, which is also the most important part.<br>Music healing is ultimately to act on people, with certain functionality, not just the appreciation of pure music, so it must have a basis. Based on the research of experiments and papers, discuss with musicians and sound excellence, and then use some more advanced audio production technologies, and add professional contents such as psychology and cognitive behavior therapy to ensure that the album is professional and effective, and at the same time, it also conforms to the aesthetics of Chinese people in music.<br>In addition to the ears, with the vigorous development of scene music, there are also a large number of scene music content creators in the market. Based on the market demand, kugou launched an open platform for self-service distribution of scene music and video content; After the content is released, the cool dog traffic bonus will be shared to realize diversified realization. It is understood that the open platform has gathered more than 10000 creators of various contents.<br>In addition to the online market, the exploration of music therapy online and offline has existed long ago, and the current expression methods are becoming more and more diversified.<br>The heart rhyme healing Academy established by Wang Yuan in 2006 is the leader in the sound Bowl Healing industry. At present, it has trained more than 6000 healers. The sound bowl training camp of heart rhyme therapy lasts for 12 days. The first 7 days are first-order and second-order techniques and case study; The next 5 days are marketing training. Compared with Songbo, Yinbo is more committed to cultivating excellent Yinbo healers. On December 15, 2021, the first five senses healing education and training demonstration base in China officially landed at Xinyun Beijing headquarters.<br>During the Spring Festival, due to the popularity of short-term training, Shanghai Songbo Yinbo physical and mental therapist training class is also called to start the human body’s self-healing ability through listening and physical contact, so as to help the human body restore a balanced and harmonious state of health. Fees range from 1180 yuan for the primary level to 3980 yuan for the advanced level, and the service of examining the certificate of sound therapy tutor is also provided.<br>Although there are different views on whether the effect of sound therapy can meet the expectations on the Internet, Shanghai nianqian Culture Communication Co., Ltd., established in 2018, is sought after by a group of fans for its sub-health status and career development anxiety of contemporary people.<br>The ear circle also mentioned with fawn horn music finance that some hotels will ask them to customize some albums in order to provide soothing sleep supporting music or vocals when guests sleep. The monthly club will also customize some music to help mothers alleviate anxiety and depression.<br>With the development of science and technology, AI technology has also brought new development to the music therapy industry. The ear circle mentioned that the healing music has been shaped into a three-dimensional auditory scene through some 3D engine technology and the production of virtual reality content. In the future, it may involve some means of using artificial intelligence algorithms to generate music.<br>Muru music health, founded abroad in 2020, claims to be the first music streaming media platform for people over the age of 60. It creates a personalized music experience through AI according to users’ hobbies and interests, and uses AI technology to resist the impact of brain aging. At present, the software charges its members a $67.90 (about $50) every six months, and has established an exclusive music partnership with Universal Music Australia to obtain a larger music library and cooperate with Google cloud to technically start faster and smarter work.<br>Hebei Caiwen Technology Co., Ltd. in China is a high-tech company focusing on EEG research, low-frequency sound wave pulse application and EMT EEG music therapy. Its frequency music medical team has launched frequency music headphones through the combination of low-frequency sound wave pulse technology and music therapy.<br>Referring to the current development status of the industry, the ear team said that from the experience of these two or three years, the industry is still in its infancy. The logic of the whole industry is not very clear, including the source of income and how to realize it. However, from the user feedback, there are particularly many people with sleep problems and psychological problems. Chen Fuguo, a teacher from the ear group, once said that at present, almost one-third to one-quarter of people in clinical practice have sleep problems. In addition, patients with anxiety, depression and fear also account for the majority of patients. From this perspective, music therapy still has development prospects.<br>In addition, although the overall industry is not particularly large, we have begun to pay attention to it slowly. From the amount of broadcasting in the ear, the epidemic has also prompted people to pay more attention to sleep and mental health.<br>But at the same time, some chaos also accompanied.<br>In 2020, a kind of music called “subliminal” became popular in station B. up owners claim that this kind of music can not only listen more and more beautiful, comparable to painless cosmetic surgery, but also improve financial status, eliminate viruses and private customized wishes. For a time, the number of hits of various videos has soared. At present, the number of hits of “true! High nose bridge &#x2F; nose base dry goods, sharing at the bottom of up” has exceeded 400000. However, at the top of the video, station B has marked the words “this content is for entertainment only, please don’t believe it”.<br>This kind of “song + positive guide + several good-looking photos” is a combination. Subliminal has existed on YouTube for several years, but there has been constant negative news. Blogger sapien medicine even added a sales link directly below his subliminal video. The price ranged from $22 or $3 to $136, which was called fraud by many netizens.<br>Another blogger, mind power, was accused of hiding some dark subconscious ideas in the video, which plunged the audience into nightmares and greatly affected their mental state. Some people were even sent to the emergency room. However, these symptoms gradually disappeared within a few weeks after she stopped using it. Although mind power’s account was closed, the debate continued. Rose subliminals, another blogger, publicly admitted that she had added negative hints to the video. After that, she chose to quit the subconscious community and close her YouTube account.<br>Some netizens attribute it to music therapy. So, does this belong to the category of music therapy? We consulted Gao Tian, whose master’s thesis is about the study of subliminal music. Gao Tian said that from an academic point of view, no matter looking through previous papers or through his own experiments, no significant difference was found, so this method can not be said to be useful or useless.<br>However, in the business world, no matter whether it is useful or not, as long as they see the business opportunities, some people boast that this thing is magical, “even if someone wants to cooperate with themselves, I refuse. I say you can do research on science, but push it to the market without the support of solid experimental data. I think this is a kind of deception”.<br>Gao Tian also cited an example. When he first returned to China in 1997, some people sold this at a high price. At that time, an ordinary music CD was about seven or eight yuan, but this kind of CD sold for 2800 yuan. It was falsely said that it was the high technology and subconscious of the United States. In addition, success learning was very popular at that time. Some people thought that after the subconscious input, they could succeed, Can make a fortune, so I don’t care about the 2800 yuan.<br>However, for the chaos of industry development, discipline leaders have been trying to lead the public out of misunderstanding.<br>Liu Mingming, director of the music therapy center of the Central Conservatory of music, once pointed out that music therapy is not a music prescription for symptomatic listening to music. Music is directly related to everyone’s growth background, social environment and cultural environment. Everyone has different feelings about the same music work. So we can’t say which music solves what problem like prescribing.<br>But at the same time, music has something in common. For example, medium speed and slow music with soft melody can make people relax, but it’s like asking the doctor what kind of diet is conducive to health. The doctor will give you a balanced diet, eat more vegetables and fruits and eat less greasy. It’s the most basic principle and doesn’t involve targeted treatment suggestions.<br>Liu Mingming also stressed that music therapy is not a simple collage of “music + psychology + medicine”, and in addition to theoretical learning, it is also a highly practical discipline. Therefore, music therapists need comprehensive professional training. They can’t become music therapists by participating in short-term training. About the professional training of music therapists The issue of industry access standards for qualification certification needs to be discussed.<br>But at the same time, in addition to the professional concept of music therapist, music belongs to all mankind. Everyone has the right, ability and conditions to use music to enrich and beautify their own life, and apply music to life for self adjustment, which everyone can do.<br>Generally speaking, in terms of discipline, the goal of music therapy major in Colleges and universities is to cultivate music therapy professionals who meet the needs of society.<br>Cui Yiyun, a new generation practitioner of music therapy who graduated from the Central Conservatory of music, once said that music therapy is relatively mature in Beijing. There are professional music therapy in the Autism Center of Bo’ai hospital and the psychology department of Beijing Anding Hospital. However, in more and more cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Foshan, Wuxi, Hangzhou and Qinhuangdao, Music therapy has begun to appear.<br>In the market, there are various music therapy institutions, clinics and apps, and the industry is still sporadic and scattered.

          <p>Key points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Cambodian “blood slave” incident has put 58 cities on the cusp of the storm. Many 58 employees in the same city said frankly to Sina technology that false information is the “ancestral problem” of the company.</li>
<li>On China’s judicial documents online, 5638 documents can be found by searching “58 cities” and “causes of criminal cases”. Many criminals recruit accomplices and look for criminal targets in 58 the same city.</li>
<li>It is rumored that 58 companies in the same city have heard Yao Jinbo’s laissez faire attitude towards false information on the grounds that “the penalty loss due to false information is less than the loss due to business adjustment”.<br>“58 city, a magical website!” This advertising word became popular from Yang Mi’s mouth and spread all over the streets.<br>But for those victims, the “magical” 58 city brings nightmares.<br>According to the information on the official website of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, a man surnamed Li was attracted by false job advertisements on the Internet and was coerced by criminal gangs to smuggle into Cambodia. Later, he was illegally detained by the early online gambling and electronic fraud gang in Sihanouk port, and was drawn a lot of blood for many times, resulting in his life in danger. The man mentioned in an interview that his nightmare began with a job advertisement in the same city. The advertisement claims that a nightclub in Guangxi recruits security guards with a salary of 6000 yuan per month.<br>In other words, without this advertisement, men might not have suffered accidents.<br>A few days ago, 58 city responded to the matter: it has been communicated to the relevant departments, the case is under continuous investigation, and it has not been determined that the victim saw the recruitment information in 58 city, nor the recruitment information released by the corresponding enterprise.<br>Whether the same city is really involved in the case remains to be determined by the investigation results of the police of the two countries. But for a long time, the accusations of fraud in 58 cities have never stopped.<h3 id="False-information-58-ancestral-problems-in-the-same-city"><a href="#False-information-58-ancestral-problems-in-the-same-city" class="headerlink" title="False information, 58 ancestral problems in the same city"></a>False information, 58 ancestral problems in the same city</h3>“58 false information in the same city is an ancestral problem.” A 58 city employee commented.<br>Before joining 58, she also suffered losses in renting a house in the same city. Not long after renting a house in 58 the same city, he was threatened by the black intermediary and had to move out of the house whose lease had not expired, and the remaining rent and deposit could not be taken back.<br>Her professional experience in 58 made her realize that false information is a difficult problem almost unsolvable in 58. Whether it is recruitment, renting or second-hand transactions, there are a large number of false information.<br>“In July 2018, my good friend resold a Jingdong card on 58 and was cheated by the screenshot of forged transfer records.” a user told Sina technology that before long, he himself encountered a new scam on the transfer under 58 and fell into a serial trap after being photographed by the buyer for idle items, Finally, the customer service forged by the fraudsters was cheated out of 2200 yuan on the grounds of “authentication is required for the collection of goods sold”.<br>The same case is not uncommon on the consumer service platform black cat.<br>In October 2020, a user saw a Guangzhou company recruiting a clerk in 58 cities, so he arrived at the interview place according to the time and place provided by the other party, but was asked to spend 430 yuan for certificates to start the interview. After the user paid for the certificate, he was asked to go home and wait for the work arrangement. After waiting for half a month, there was no news, so I went to ask for a refund again. So far, the refund has not arrived.<br>Some users complained that they encountered a black intermediary in the same city in 58. Under the name of “introducing to work in a bar”, they took themselves and three others to the so-called workplace. They were not only required to pay 300 yuan for clothing and 60 yuan for information, but also took their personal ID card to handle mobile phone cards.<br>…………<br>As of February 21, the number of complaints about 58 in the same city on black cat had reached 9656, and there were new complaints about 58 in the same city almost every day, mostly focusing on recruitment fraud, fraudulent use of domestic services, malicious misappropriation of funds and so on.<br>A former employee of 58 in the same city told Sina technology that next to the front desk of 58 headquarters building in Jiuxianqiao, Beijing, there is a room dedicated to receiving and mediating door-to-door defenders. Many of the door-to-door defenders are users who have encountered fraud and suffered great losses in 58 in the same city. “Almost every day, there is an endless stream. Before, the company was surrounded by defenders.” He said.<br>Sina science and technology found that there are not many criminal acts breeding in 58 cities.<br>For example, the judgment of case No. (2021) yuxingzhong No. 129 shows that Xinhua guarantee company has published advertisements in 58 cities and ganji.com (which has been merged by 58 cities) for extensive publicity, exaggerated its company strength and absorbed social public funds at high interest rates. Finally, the legal person of the company was convicted of fund-raising fraud and loan fraud.<br>Case number (2021), Chongqing 30 and case No. 2020 (2020) Yun sentence 1008, the suspect has found that the suspects were recruited by the couple in the 58 cities to transport drugs. Case number (2020) Yun punishment No. 1001 judgment shows that the suspect found the object of fraud through the rental information of 58 cities. Case number (2018), the sentence No. 356 of Xiang Ling, showed that the suspect had formed a fraud group by recruiting 58 confederates.<h3 id="Why-are-criminals-keen-on-58-recruitment"><a href="#Why-are-criminals-keen-on-58-recruitment" class="headerlink" title="Why are criminals keen on 58 recruitment?"></a>Why are criminals keen on 58 recruitment?</h3>The actual experience of sina technology found that the threshold for recruitment on 58 is quite low, and reducing the cost of crime has become the breeding ground for crime.<br>On the 58 same city website, Sina technology can choose to publish full-time recruitment information after making up a job information, address information and enterprise name at will. However, before confirming the release, 58 cities are forced to join the job seeker protection plan. This so-called security plan is actually a deposit. If a cash account is used, it only needs to pay 10000 yuan.<br>This deposit can be refunded, even if it is non refundable. For many criminals, due to the huge benefits, this cost is not enough to become an obstacle - the victim of the “blood slave case” in Cambodia was sold to a network investment company in Sihanouk port by the traffickers who recruited him at a price of US $18500 (about 117000 yuan).<br>On the introduction page of the job seeker security plan, Sina Technology found that 58 cities require two commitments for members and non members to join the plan - the recruitment information is true and effective, and the recruitment behavior conforms to the platform and national regulations. But in fact, there is little guarantee for 58 cities to fulfill this commitment, making it more difficult to verify the authenticity and effectiveness of recruitment information.<br>After the successful release of the position, if it is not certified by the enterprise, the released position information is likely to be taken off the shelf. However, it is not difficult to complete the enterprise certification. It not only provides the agency service of business license on the Internet, but also the information publisher can complete the enterprise certification through the business license and other materials obtained from other channels due to the lack of audit.<br>On the page of 58 city, there is a prompt that “all recruiters will be required to pass (enterprise) certification from July”. However, according to media reports, the statement of 58 city is very vague. It is not clear which July it is. Even the official customer service of 58 city provides different statements in the consultation.<br>“What 58 does is blue collar recruitment, which is more about sinking the market. What 58’s China talent network does is white-collar recruitment, which is of relatively higher quality.” A 58 former employee in the same city told Sina technology that in comparison, chinatalent.com can bring more income, so it invests more resources and has more strict audit. 58. The income brought by recruitment is relatively small, and the audit will be relatively loose. “If 58 recruitment review is more stringent, the willingness to use it will decline for small and micro enterprises.” He said.<br>This statement undoubtedly exposes the loopholes behind 58 recruitment. Due to the sinking market, users’ willingness to pay is low, the use threshold of small and micro enterprises is low, and the willingness to pay high amounts is weak, which leads to 58 recruitment falling into such a cycle - low income, lax audit, proliferation of false information and frequent accidents.<br>“It’s hard to say whether it really happened in 58 recruitment this time before the end of the investigation. But if it’s related to 58, it will undoubtedly face some rectification.” The former employee said.<br>However, Sina Technology also found on the 58 city recruitment page that compared with the intelligent positions such as finance, audit, design and development engineers provided by chinatalent.com, 58 recruitment provides physical positions such as side dishes, loading, courier, shopping guide and waiter.<br>The business model of 58 city also determines that it is difficult to rectify these false information and protect user information - 58 city heavily depends on the provision of information services to obtain income, and the main source of income is the fees paid by information publishers.<br>The last financial report before the privatization of 58 city shows that in the first quarter of 2020, 58 city revenue was 2.5603 billion yuan, the average number of paying merchants was about 2.7 million, and member services contributed 815.6 million yuan.<br>58 city relies on the local service industry. Due to the impact of the epidemic, the revenue and the average number of paying merchants in the same city in the first quarter of 2020 increased negatively on a double ring basis - its fourth financial report in 2019 showed that the total number of paying merchants in the same city was about 3.3 million, and the membership service contributed 1.11 billion yuan.<br>Today, 58 cities in the recovery channel with the epidemic under control have no motivation to crack down on false information and cut off their own financial resources. “What’s more, if the audit is strengthened, it means that many auditors need to be recruited in all business locations to complete online and offline audit, which is a huge expenditure.” The former employee said.<br>A 58 city company once said that in the previous negative public opinion event, Yao Jinbo, CEO of 58 city, had been advised to take the opportunity to change the business model to reduce the negative public opinion brought by false information. The reason why Yao Jinbo refused the adjustment was that the cost of his business model was increased, but in fact, there was no reason for Yao Jinbo to refuse the adjustment, which resulted in the loss of false information.<br>But this statement has not been officially confirmed. In April 2021, in the tide of antitrust, Yao Jinbo called on relevant departments to punish the monopoly behavior of competitors’ shells, which was quite eye-catching.<br>However, 58 people in the same city who have caused damage to users’ property and even life safety due to false information induction for many times may be the one who should be punished with a huge amount.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, Sina Technology (ID:techsina).

          <p>In 2022, the red envelope war of the Spring Festival Gala ended. JD gave out red envelopes and gifts worth 1.5 billion yuan. Finally, the total number of interactions was fixed at 69.1 billion.<br>Seven years ago, wechat won the turnaround in the field of online payment by “sending red envelopes”. Since then, Kwai Fu exclusive partners have been a marketing mark for Internet companies. Taobao, Baidu, tiktok, jitter, Jingdong and so on have been in the market.<br>From the perspective of public image, compared with ALI meituan, who was issued an antitrust ticket, and Didi, who was frustrated in listing in the United States, JD, which is transforming a new entity enterprise and focuses on supply chain empowerment, seems to have got a “safety card”.<br>In order to “send” the red envelope of the Spring Festival Gala, JD has made many preparations internally. The red envelope project of Jingdong Spring Festival Gala is in the overall charge of Xu Lei, President of Jingdong group, led by Xin Lijun, CEO of Jingdong retail, and supported by Jingdong Logistics, Jingdong technology and other sub groups.<br>Chang Liang, senior director of JD cloud infrastructure research and development department, once told the interface news that during the Spring Festival Gala, the items related to the red envelope link of the Spring Festival Gala are at level s, and the other items are classified as ABC according to their importance. Even the items classified as level s in the past 618 will be degraded according to the situation.<br>There are reasons why Jingdong pays so much attention to the reality of this Spring Festival Gala.<br>According to the financial report data, although the traffic of Jingdong main station has entered a growth period after the market sinking, the growth rate of annual active users has slowed down. In the third quarter of last year, JD had 552 million active users, a net increase of 110 million over the same period in 2020, but its year-on-year growth rate fell to 25% from 29% in the first quarter of 2021.<br>Its seven fresh food business is still focused on the first and second tier cities in Beijing Tianjin Hebei and Dawan district; Jingxi Pinpin withdrew from Fujian, Gansu, Guizhou, Jilin, Ningxia and Qinghai last year, and it is difficult to undertake the task of developing a sinking market under the contraction situation; The cycle of offline channels such as Jingdong electric appliance city flagship store and wanzhentong Township store is too long, and the cost is unknown.<br>For JD, the Spring Festival Gala may be another opportunity to open up the situation after community group buying. We should know that the Spring Festival Gala still has a strong influence in the sinking market and has a wide audience, which helps Internet companies improve their user structure and can be used as a fast track to open the sinking market.<br>Now that the Spring Festival is over, has JD’s red envelope marketing achieved twice the result with half the effort?<br>Only from the number of interactions, it seems that the Spring Festival Gala of the year of the tiger undertaken by JD is not as “lively” as last year. According to the 2021 Spring Festival evening data released last year, the total number of red envelopes during the Spring Festival Gala was 70 billion 300 million, higher than that of the tiktok year 69 billion 100 million times.<br>In addition to the Jingdong main station, the Jingdong app matrix is also “digesting” the huge traffic of the Spring Festival gala as much as possible. During the Spring Festival Gala of the year of the tiger, Jingxi app launched the activity of “shaking the red envelope for 300 million during the Spring Festival”. According to the data released by jd.com, the event issued more than 158 million coupons and attracted more than 32.27 million people.<br>However, Jingdong and tiktok APP attributes are not the same. Compared with the short video platform, e-commerce applications pay more attention to the transformation from interactive number to order behavior.<br>According to the Spring Festival consumption trend released by JD big data, as of February 5, the turnover during the Spring Festival in 2022 increased by more than 50% year-on-year (year-on-year in the lunar calendar from the 30th of the year to the fifth day of the first month). According to the statistics of the online connection clearing platform, the online connection platform handled a total of 4.20 trillion yuan of inter agency online payment transactions five days before the Spring Festival holiday, with a year-on-year growth rate of 11.58%.<br>This means that the growth rate of Jingdong’s transaction volume during the Spring Festival has been higher than the average growth rate of online payment at the social level.<br>At the user level, affected by the interactive activities of the Spring Festival Gala, the activity of JD young users has also increased. Data show that during the Spring Festival Gala, the interaction volume of young people under the age of 35 accounted for more than 56%, exceeding the annual average. Jingdong supermarket has searched more than 110 million times for annual gift boxes, of which 71% of users are post-80s and post-90s.<br>It is worth mentioning that under the promotion of the red envelope of the Spring Festival Gala and the new year’s goods Festival, the sales of goods in non JD advantage categories such as services have increased, among which the orders of goods such as laundry services, health services (package), automobile services and pet services have increased by 6 to 10 times over the same period of the lunar calendar last year.<br>According to the data released by jd.com, through the flow pool of the Spring Festival Gala, jd.com has successfully improved the consumption intention of platform users to a certain extent. At the same time, it has promoted young users under the age of 35, but it does not rule out the short-term bonus during the Spring Festival Gala red envelope and the Spring Festival.<br>At the telephone conference in the third quarter of 2021, Xu Lei, President of JD group, mentioned that about 75% of JD’s new users come from the sinking market. At the same time, Xu Lei divides the new users into two groups: 45 years old and above and 18 to 25 years old. He pointed out that it takes some time for users aged 18 to 25 to improve their ARPU value (average income per user), which generally takes half a year or four to five times of consumption.<br>Therefore, in the long run, how to seize the short-term benefits, improve the experience of young consumers and achieve user precipitation in the sinking market is still an issue that JD needs to consider in the next step.<br>This article is from “interface news”, reporter: Yu Hao, 36 krypton, authorized release.</p>

Next, we will focus more than 50% on the R &amp; D and construction of our own brands, establish differentiated competitive barriers, and strive to achieve a Gmv proportion of 30% - 40%.<br>This shift stems from the sales experience of an Emoji luminous mask. During the epidemic, newme showed a luminous Emoji mask in the tiktok live studio, selling 10000 pieces in just four days. But this product was not created by newme. It was sold by Amazon five years ago. At that time, the product had a general response. The live broadcast of newme made this mask popular and also gave those Amazon stores a “free ride”, receiving 30000 mask orders in a week.<br>This makes Gu Jun realize that only by building his own brand and increasing the scarcity of products, can we continuously improve the repurchase rate of consumers in newme, break through the bottleneck of “product going to sea” and realize “brand going to sea”.<br>In Gu Jun’s view, cross-border e-commerce will mostly experience business evolution from OEM to white brand and then to private brand. Newme plans to start from the front of the supply chain, redefine products and upgrade design to build its own brand through accurate user portraits.<br>Gu Jun admitted that one of newme’s learning objectives is the cross-border e-commerce platform sheen. Sheen has strong content production capacity and strong supply chain management ability, through the content high-frequency update of front-end traffic and the quick response of small orders in the back-end supply chain. As early as 2015-2018, sheen began to use technology to transform the supply chain and enable the factory Kanban and production management system to reduce inventory and improve the efficiency of the supply chain.<br>However, it is not easy to replicate the success of sheen. Damonstudio, a cross-border e-commerce independent station benchmarked to sheen under byte, recently announced the closure of website operations. Some cross-border e-commerce racetrack investors believe that there is a big gap between damonstudio and sheen in terms of new user recognition, business maturity and supply chain management, which is more like byte’s water test in cross-border e-commerce business. However, this will not stop byte people from looking for the next sheen, and cross-border e-commerce is also becoming a new battlefield for Internet manufacturers. As of January 2022, cross-border e-commerce financing has exceeded 100 million, including Sequoia and other head institutions.<br>In particular, after Amazon’s “store closure tide” not long ago, cross-border e-commerce independent stations quickly became popular, and coincidentally chose the live delivery mode of light capital to market in tiktok. Gu Jun also pointed out that with the popularity of overseas live broadcasting and goods carrying industry, overseas offline retail industry has also started online live broadcasting at the same time. Taking advantage of tiktok, newme will also face off with large supermarkets such as target and Costco.<br>Ji Wei, founding managing partner of Huaying capital, said that driven by the epidemic and other factors in recent years, overseas e-commerce has developed rapidly. The e-commerce of the traffic platform represented by tiktok will bring huge market space in the future. Newme is one of the first authorized sellers in China, which can realize closed-loop trading in tiktok station and has unique top allocation rights in its e-commerce system. Newme team has been deeply engaged in traffic e-commerce for many years. Both founders have more than ten years of Internet and retail entrepreneurship experience, have a deep understanding of supply chain and brand, and have strong traffic operation ability.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:DsstCapital, and is published by Zhang Junwen, 36 krypton authorized by Dongsishitiao.</p>

          <p>In the era of fragmented attention economy, more and more people are used to browsing the grass planting notes written by others on the Internet before placing an order, so as to understand the useful information about the use feeling, quality parameters, functional characteristics, price range, precautions and so on.<br>For individual consumers, this can not only avoid detours, but also compare goods in terms of price, and the form of grass planting has developed from the initial good thing sharing and use experience to various forms such as live delivery, online popular exploration stores and professional evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="01-content-grass-planting-has-become-one-of-the-important-ways-of-commercial-brand-marketing"><a href="#01-content-grass-planting-has-become-one-of-the-important-ways-of-commercial-brand-marketing" class="headerlink" title="01 content grass planting has become one of the important ways of commercial brand marketing"></a>01 content grass planting has become one of the important ways of commercial brand marketing</h3><p>Now the content operation has become a common practice, and the grass planting economy has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Crow Rui released the Research Report on the grass planting power of three platforms in 2020. Its content shows that nearly 80% of respondents said they had been planted by KOL, and nearly 70% of users believe that the grass planting content has a great impact on their final purchase behavior. At the end of last year, The survey results of the joint questionnaire network of the social survey center of China Youth Daily also show that more than 80% of the respondents will go online to search for relevant grass planting recommendations before shopping.<br>Cui Qian is a post-90s white-collar worker. Before buying large or expensive goods, she is used to searching online grass sharing, product recommendation, evaluation and comparison to see how others use their experience, and then choose products in combination with her own economic strength. If she can’t make up her mind at the moment, she will find some professional analysis of experts for reference.<br>Cui Qian is usually busy with her work, and her personal energy is really limited. In addition, there are many kinds of goods, and she doesn’t have time to choose from them one by one. Therefore, it can save a lot of time to buy goods directly by browsing the content of planting grass. Of course, in order to avoid stepping on the pit, Cui Qian suggests that it’s best to look at the consumption evaluation of different websites or creators, In particular, focus on negative comments.<br>In recent years, many social platforms, Internet e-commerce and content operation enterprises have focused on the track of grass growing economy and made efforts to layout one after another. Zhihu started the recruitment plan of MCN creators in 2019. Since its listing at the beginning of last year, Zhihu began to accelerate the pace of commercial construction and operation promotion of platform content, and first released the “cheese platform”, The function of the platform is to build a bridge for content cooperation and traffic transformation for creators and brand customers.<br>At the end of last year, Zhihu held the first ecological Partner Conference and released a number of plans. The purpose is to gradually attract the enthusiastic participation of various types of content creators by further strengthening commercial operation on the basis of previous professional operation, so as to establish a new way of content marketing and flow realization.<br>Specifically, Zhihu will focus on beauty, skin care, digital and other fields, and provide corresponding content marketing solutions or marketing tools for customers in different industries and brands by gathering corresponding content creation forces. For example, Zhihu’s good thing recommendation function can support the jump to e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, jd.com, pinduoduo and so on, To achieve accurate docking with brands or businesses, commercial content marketing has become one of the main positions of knowing revenue, accounting for about one-third of its total revenue.<br>B tiktok and shaking platform have similar functions, which can link the creators and brand customers to realize the content operation and commercial promotion. At present, many head enterprises or platforms have already been quite popular in content sharing and flow planting, but these enterprises are still facing different degrees of difficulty in sharing grass and straw contents and drainage and business transformation. Kwai tiktok and Taobao do or think the same without prior consulation2. Since last year, the content and operation platform of live broadcasting providers and other vendors have been speeding up the pace of deepening and improving the layout of the platform.<br>After the popularity and content cultural creation atmosphere are cultivated, all platforms are also trying to create an ecological and trading chain suitable for the development of brands and businesses. The ultimate goal is to build an ecological closed loop from content sharing to commercial operation. At the same time, we can also predict that the competition of all platforms in this field will only become increasingly fierce in the future.</p>
<h3 id="02-video-and-live-broadcast-drainage-are-the-general-trend-of-content-grass-planting-in-the-future"><a href="#02-video-and-live-broadcast-drainage-are-the-general-trend-of-content-grass-planting-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="02 video and live broadcast drainage are the general trend of content grass planting in the future"></a>02 video and live broadcast drainage are the general trend of content grass planting in the future</h3><p>Compared with graphics, video grass planting forms undoubtedly have richer visual expression and impact. Therefore, the protagonist of content grass planting is also changing from graphics to video. Many content platforms are also actively encouraging and supporting the creation of MCN. Publishers can get more traffic support in this regard. At the same time, from the current traffic transformation situation, Live e-commerce may become the next breakthrough in the transformation of content platform to commercialization.<br>According to the data of Dongxing securities, the market scale of domestic live broadcasting e-commerce reached 2 trillion yuan last year. Compared with other content operation and traffic conversion methods, live broadcasting e-commerce has the advantages of strong intuition and interaction. Moreover, an excellent KOL is easier to win the trust of users. Live broadcasting can more conveniently help operators establish a value closed loop integrating content grass planting and commercial operation, So as to achieve the goal of rapid and efficient transformation relying on high-quality user groups.<br>AI Kwai consulting tiktok reported that the total merchandise transaction volume of Taobao live broadcast sector in 2020 (GMV) was about 400000000000 yuan, and the shaking sound was about 500000000000 Yuan, and the fast business electricity business sector was close to 400 billion yuan, which way ahead of the live broadcast business of other platforms.<br>Tiktok tiktok tiktok tiktok has increased the content of grass and passenger group transformation to a more important strategic level. Before a while, the jitter used to test grass planting function in its APP, and its jitter box also gradually exerting force in this field. At present, the voice has basically established a closed loop transaction from direct broadcast to electricity conversion, which of course makes other competitors feel pressure.<br>Kwai Kwai and the US group reached a strategic cooperation in drainage transformation last December. Users can place orders on the fast track group’s small programs when they are willing to brush short videos and have the intention to purchase. After the order is successful, the creators of the content will receive corresponding profits. CoCo, Kwai TSE, purple garden, and Book Burning herbs also have the same benefits. 85 degrees C and other domestic well-known chain catering brands have become the first batch of merchants to settle in.<br>Besides the catering items, the US group will follow the following programs: hotel accommodation, tourist attractions, entertainment, hairdressing and other life service categories. With the help of the fast user’s daily user browsing volume, Kwai Kwai, the US group, the creative side, the brand side and the users have become a closed loop of consumption from content sharing to value realization.</p>

Whether it is the traditional goods of large and small e-commerce or the new consumer brands rising with the tide of the country, such as Yuanqi forest, perfect diary, bubble Mart, huaxizi, etc., all rely on the mode of content grass planting to a great extent, It has won the attention of the market and consumer groups, thus laying a good foundation for further growth and development.<br>For major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms, it is not difficult to establish a content creation and sharing mechanism including graphics, video, live broadcast, etc. the biggest difficulty lies in how to stabilize the traffic within the platform, rather than sharing the content on the platform as before, and finally users go to other e-commerce platforms, wechat The embarrassing situation of purchase and transaction of commercial and social media such as community.<br>Second, platform enterprises need to establish a perfect and attractive product or service system, which should include e-commerce supply service chain including commodity supply, merchant entry, payment and settlement, warehousing and logistics and other elements. Only in this way can we realize full flow transformation, Enterprises or e-commerce platforms can also obtain sufficient value returns from commercial operations in various ways.<br>From the current situation, the traffic conversion business still has a lot of room for improvement in the future development of major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms. Among them, deep cultivation of content operation and encouraging creators and brands to continuously supply high-quality original content are the basis for commodity sharing and traffic conversion. Efficient and convenient marketing and commercial cash realization methods are the key to improve the purchase conversion rate and repurchase rate of user groups. These two aspects are complementary and mutually reinforcing, In the future, it will become the primary goal of major Internet e-commerce and content operation platforms.<br>For example, in recent years, content operation and traffic transformation have also become an important development direction of Taobao platform. Taobao has built a marketing matrix including Taobao live broadcast, Taobao headlines, Youku, good goods, etc. through internal introduction, outreach and maneuvering. Taobao shopping launched the year before last also integrates the content creation functions of individuals, businesses and brands. It can combine the content with graphics, video Live broadcast and other forms are presented to users from multiple angles.<br>Although there is still a certain gap between Taobao and expectations in terms of content diversity, professionalism and user stickiness, based on the huge user flow and transaction volume of Taobao system matrix and its convenient closed-loop advantages from content operation to transaction conversion, it is not difficult for us to predict that Taobao will have a promising future in this field.</p>
<h3 id="04-conclusion"><a href="#04-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="04 conclusion"></a>04 conclusion</h3><p>“Yu Jian column” believes that the traffic dividend in the Internet era is gradually fading, and the endless e-commerce platforms and commercial entrances make the Internet economy fragmented and decentralized. In the past, the way of accumulating popularity through content operation, developing brand advertising business and building business private traffic is gradually entering the bottleneck.<br>Both the content operation platform and Internet e-commerce are building a closed-loop system from content to transaction, and strive to form an efficient commercial transformation link including graphics, short video and live broadcast. When the platform operator establishes an efficient link from content creation to commercial operation, In the era of attention economy, enterprises can seize the first opportunity and take the lead in striving for user resources.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:yujianzhuanlan, and is published by Yu Bin, 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>No one can’t live without an iron boss or a flowing executive.<br>Even the brothers who started a business after drinking millet porridge with Lei Jun are leaving one after another. The nearest one is Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12.<br>Before leaving office, he served as vice chairman and Secretary General of Xiaomi Technical Committee and was one of the earliest founding team members of Xiaomi. Even, he once showed his love in an interview with the media, “I just married Xiaomi.”<br>Before Li Weixing, Lei Jun just sent off Chang Cheng, vice president of the company and general manager of Xiaomi mobile phone products department at the end of January 2022. Chang Cheng comes from Lenovo and is one of the members of Lei Jun’s “Avenger alliance”.<br>Before Chang Cheng, Lei Jun bid farewell to Zhou Shouzi, President of Xiaomi International Department, who made great contributions to Xiaomi’s investment and listing. After leaving Xiaomi, Zhou Shouzi switched to Zhang Yiming’s command, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>Seeing off the brothers one after another was Liu qiangdong.<br>A few months ago, Zhou Bowen, chairman of Jingdong Technical Committee and President of Jingdong Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Xu Ling, head of the group’s Strategy Department known as the “father of IOUS” of Jingdong, and Xiao Jun, vice president of Jingdong group and President of X business unit, left successively.<br>For Liu qiangdong, this may have been commonplace. There have been too many executives coming in and out of Jingdong in recent years. Jingdong has transported many management talents for the retail and fresh food industries. A few years ago, Lei Jun also said, “no veterans, no inheritance. No recruits, no future.”<br>Of course, the resignation of senior executives is an ordinary thing, but it is not necessarily simple behind the ordinary. Generally speaking, they either leave for personal or family reasons, or have a better place to go, or they are forced to leave because they can’t satisfy their boss. But this is also a window to observe a company, so that we can see its development status, strategic changes, future direction, etc.<br>People are the opposite of the company.</p>
<h3 id="01-Xiaomi-transition"><a href="#01-Xiaomi-transition" class="headerlink" title="01 Xiaomi transition"></a>01 Xiaomi transition</h3><p>Xiaomi confirmed to the media that Li Weixing has indeed left and wants to return to his hometown in Guangzhou.<br>Li Weixing, who grew up in Guangzhou and studied computer science at Sun Yat sen University, first joined Microsoft in 2005 to be responsible for the research and development of windows phone camera software. In 2009, Lin bin, who was at Google, was ready to start a business with Lei Jun, so he introduced his little alumni Li Weixing to Lei Jun.<br>According to Li Weixing’s memory, Lei Jun talked with him for several hours, talked about some things he had done and was doing, talked about the current situation of the mobile phone industry, his views on smart phones, the goal of making Xiaomi mobile phones, etc. “It’s mutual understanding.”<br>Lei Jun also revealed that he met more than 100 people in three months at that time. The opening remarks are always about who I am, what I have done and who I want to find. Can you give me a chance to meet and talk.<br>To a certain extent, Li Weixing saw that Lei Jun still had a halo and decided to join in a few days later.<br>First from the left: Li Weixing, employee of Xiaomi No. 12<br>In the early days, Li Weixing was responsible for the development of MIUI in Xiaomi. Even, he didn’t have much expectations for Xiaomi and Lei Jun. According to the Mars laboratory, Li Weixing believed only one tenth of Lei Jun’s first big cake for Xiaomi. “At that time, the expectation was not so high, but it was very satisfied to achieve the effect of big cake.”.<br>After Xiaomi went public in 2018, Lei Jun made a large-scale organizational structure adjustment, and Li Weixing emerged as a young man.<br>Lei Jun set up four new Internet business departments, and Li Weixing became the general manager of Internet Department 1, reporting directly to Lei Jun. Internet department I is composed of some departments of MIUI and some departments of Xiaomi mutual Entertainment Department, which is responsible for MIUI core experience, technology middle stage, commercial product R &amp; D and advertising sales, game distribution, business cooperation and MIUI international business.<br>Lei Jun explained, “we must hand over the front-line business position to young people, so that young talents can emerge and make achievements like in the early stage of entrepreneurship. We must constantly integrate fresh blood, so as to have a long-term mechanism for talent echelon handover.”<br>Only six months later, Li Weixing was transferred to the fourth Internet department as general manager. In 2020, Xiaomi Internet business department was integrated again, and Li Weixing was transferred to Xiaomi Technical Committee until he left.<br>In fact, after Xiaomi appeared on the market, Lei Jun realized that his past playing style was a bit like guerrillas or special teams, which created many miracles and trained a number of excellent cadres. However, we can’t rely on guerrilla warfare next. We should be able to fight mobile warfare, stalemate warfare and even large regiments.<br>Therefore, in addition to Li Weixing, the young people who grew up inside Xiaomi, they need to introduce a large number of talents from the outside.<br>With the idea of being high-end and competing with apple, Lei Jun introduced a number of executives who had worked in other mobile phone brands around 2020, such as Chang Cheng from Lenovo, Lu Weibing from Jinli, Miao Lei from Nubia, Wang Xiaoyan from chili, Yang zhe from Huawei, Zeng Xuezhong from ZTE, etc.<br>The outside world ridiculed that these “losers” formed the “Avenger alliance” in Xiaomi under the influence of Lei Jun.<br>Interestingly, Chang Cheng has the name of “magneto king” in the Jianghu. Before joining Xiaomi, he served as vice president of Lenovo Group and head of mobile phone business in China. He even often compared Lenovo’s mobile phone with Xiaomi’s mobile phone and said “fight against disobedience” on his microblog.<br>But no one expected that on the last day of 2019, Chang Cheng guanxuan left Lenovo and went to Xiaomi the next day to shake hands with Lei Jun’s “enemy” and become a “brother”. He served as vice president of Xiaomi group and was responsible for mobile phone product planning.<br>Chang Cheng’s “backwater” even triggered Lenovo’s non competition agreement. Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO of Lenovo Group, once said that for enterprises, the entry and exit of talents are very normal, and I hope these entry and exit are in line with the rules. “Whether it is import or export, we should respect the market competition rules and do not involve legal issues.”<br>In October 2020, Beijing Haidian District Labor and personnel dispute arbitration commission ruled that Chang Cheng would continue to perform the obligation of non competition, pay liquidated damages of RMB 525282100 for violation of non competition, and return the non competition compensation previously paid by Lenovo.<br>Since then, the parties have not spoken on this. Chang Cheng’s journey to Xiaomi doesn’t seem to be smooth.<br>Xiaomi 10 Youth Edition is the first product Chang Cheng is responsible for after joining Xiaomi. Before the product release, the publicity copy published by Chang Cheng on the microblog caused great controversy and was denounced as vulgar by netizens. Xiaomi group and Chang Cheng himself apologized successively, and Chang Cheng also donated 100000 yuan to youth education institutions.<br>Chang Cheng joined Xiaomi for half a year. Tencent Shenwang reported that Lei Jun was not satisfied with Chang Cheng because of the controversy caused by Chang Cheng’s publicity copy published on the microblog and the poor performance of the first show of Xiaomi 10 youth version.<br>Perhaps this has already laid the groundwork for Chang Cheng’s departure. From Li Weixing to Chang Cheng, Xiaomi stumbled into the next decade.</p>
<h3 id="02-byte-expansion"><a href="#02-byte-expansion" class="headerlink" title="02 byte expansion"></a>02 byte expansion</h3><p>In 2021, Zhou Shouzi left Lei Jun and joined Zhang Yiming.<br>For Zhou Weizi’s departure, Lei Jun said “there are all kinds of reluctance”. In 2015, when he hired Zhou Shouzi, who was only 32 at that time, to be Xiaomi CFO, many people complained. At that time, Xiaomi was in trouble and was making up lessons. Lei Jun needed someone who really knew finance and investment.<br>Previously, Zhou Shouzi invested in DST. As a Singaporean, he came to Beijing alone and successively completed the investment in Jingdong, Xiaomi, Ali, Didi, today’s headlines and other projects.<br>In Lei Jun’s view, Zhou Shouzi is young, smart and has a diligence of revenge on the world. He knows that Zhou Shouzi will meet with 350 entrepreneurs every year during his DST to study entrepreneurship projects and observe the development of China’s mobile Internet. Since 2010, he has been thinking about the core competitiveness of an enterprise every day.<br>Lei Jun is not mistaken. The book “forge ahead” records the working state of Zhou Weizi during Xiaomi’s IPO. “I’ve thought about every word in the prospectus several times,” Zhou said The prospectus of the H-share version of the HKEx has a full 600 pages.<br>In November 2019, Zhou Shouzi became president of Xiaomi’s international department and became one of Xiaomi’s new partners in August the next year.

It was Zhou Shouzi who invested in today’s headlines on behalf of DST. “Byte beat: the secret from 0 to 1” recorded the scene of the two meeting.<br>After seeing Zhang Yiming, Zhou Weizi was very optimistic. He noticed the growth track of the application and thought that the founder Zhang Yiming was very capable and confident in the development direction of byte beating. Yuri Milner agreed to lead the round B financing. After the investment, he obtained a 7.2% stake, which is said to be worth $60 million. Today, even after dilution, these shares are still worth billions of dollars.<br>Zhou Shouzi<br>Zhou was funded to enter byte, first as CFO and then as CEO of tiktok.<br>“Zhou Shouzi is very familiar with our business, team and culture. He knew us during his work at DST and promoted DST to invest in us very early.”. Zhang Yiming said. As CEO of tiktok, Zhou Shouzi will be mainly responsible for corporate governance and long-term business planning.<br>Before taking over the investment this week, tiktok experienced a difficult time and was once banned in the United States. Kevin Mayer, former senior vice president of Disney, was invited to serve as byte coo and Global CEO of tiktok. Unexpectedly, Mayer left his post two months later. Later, with the new US leader taking office, the situation was alleviated.<br>At present, tiktok has more than 1 billion monthly live users. Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of meta (former Facebook), said, “tiktok is a very large competitor, and it is growing at a very fast speed. Although we have very fast development, our competitors are also growing rapidly.”<br>In the future, if tiktok is listed, Zhou’s investment can be described as “professional counterpart”.<br>Now tiktok is from music in 2018 Ly merged with the original tiktok, after byte bought music for $1 billion a year Ly, it is said that Facebook was also interested in bidding at that time.<br>Speaking of this, it is necessary to mention Liu Zhen, senior vice president in charge of byte internationalization at that time. Liu Zhen has worked as a lawyer in Silicon Valley for nearly ten years. She is known to the outside world because she launched a “taxi war” with her cousin didi president Liu Qing.<br>In August 2015, Liu Zhen became the head of Uber China strategy. According to the data at that time, in her first year in office, Uber China carried out business in 60 cities, with more than 500 employees nationwide, and the market share increased from about 2% at the beginning of 2015 to about 30%.<br>However, on August 1, 2016, Didi travel and Uber China announced their merger. According to the report of people, the people who were extremely sad after the merger also included Liu Zhen. Her expression was stiff and her voice was dumb. It can be seen that she “cried many times”.<br>Two months later, Liu Zhen joined today’s headlines. Then the latter accelerated its internationalization and successively acquired flipagram and music ly。 When talking about the acquisition at that time, Liu Zhen said it was a process of mutual trust. “We can see the potential of products and talents. We are not simply investing, but really understanding the industry technology to help their development.”<br>Liu Zhen said that she was impressed by Zhang Yiming’s ambition and that he was able to accommodate talents from multiple cultural backgrounds, which is why she joined.

Other departments of CSO system are also adjusted.<br>After leaving office, Xu Ling sent a wechat circle of friends saying, “I have always regarded curiosity and courage as my life creed, but from these experiences during this period, I found that there is a great lack. Curiosity and courage are both doing more and will be unbalanced. I should add another one to myself. I chose reconciliation, which is more rational, thinking and letting go.”<br>In February 2017, Liu qiangdong said at the 2017 annual meeting of JD group that in the second 12 years, he hoped to transform all the business models established by JD in the first 12 years into a pure technology company.<br>Qiang Dong Liu<br>Liu qiangdong began to attract technical talents in many ways.
