          <p>Two days ago, a reader told me excitedly that he had found a super simple way to make money with a monthly income of 100000. He asked me if it was feasible. I asked him what way? “We can’t reveal too much, we can only talk about the general idea,” he said<br>I didn’t really want to hear it, but I was even more puzzled by what he said. There is no big project on the Internet that has been studied by newcomers. He politely agreed and asked him to give a general idea.<br>He then said: “good content is common. This platform can fire. Basically, another platform can also fire.”<br>I said, “yes, I agree with that.”<br>He continued: “the official account of 10W+’s explosive text is sent to the headlines today with the pseudo original tools, and then cut off a key to turn it into a short video.”<br>I roughly understand. I don’t know how you feel after listening to his thoughts. Anyway, I laughed after listening.<br>I asked him, “have you ever seen anyone operate like this? Have there been any successful cases?”<br>“I haven’t seen it yet. I should be the first to think of it,” he said<br>I couldn’t help laughing. I said to him, “go and spell more search keywords. Today’s headlines move bricks and buy two at random to see if it’s the same as your idea.”<br>He shouted: “lying trough, Uncle Wang, how do you know this? How can you sell it for a few dollars? Is it difficult to get to the point that this project won’t work?”<br>I said, “not only is it sold now, but it was sold five years ago. Do you know why there are no successful cases?”<br>He was puzzled.<br>I went on to say: “You want to understand a problem. You know what a problem is. No matter today’s headlines, official account or public knowledge, there are many accounts in the team operation. They write every day conscientiously and original. They can’t recognize their parents, so they are very hard to fire and hard to make money as you say. Operate multiple accounts and spend a little time every day to make money easily?<br>If the machine can work, who will hire labor; If one person can operate multiple accounts, who will build a team; If it only takes a little time, who will be tired every day. It’s not that others didn’t think of it, but it won’t work at all. People are not stupid. Smart people don’t do things, but you think it’s good. Who’s stupid? “<br>He then asked, “is there really no project suitable for newcomers?”</p>
<h3 id="It’s-important-to-find-areas-of-interest"><a href="#It’s-important-to-find-areas-of-interest" class="headerlink" title="It’s important to find areas of interest"></a>It’s important to find areas of interest</h3><p>A classmate of mine, who watched the TV “settle down” performed by Sun Li during college, had a strong interest in real estate sales. Even if it was a book, I decided to do sales and sell houses after graduation. Relatives laughed at him. A college student ran to sell his house. Why go to college. But just because he is a graduate with good foundation and strong understanding ability, he basically won the championship every month and made 1 million in two years. He just mentioned a BMW 5 series last year. When he went home for the new year, all the people who saw jokes shut up. “<br>“I’m very interested in our media, but I don’t know how to start,” he said<br>I said, “it’s not difficult to start with. Remember four words - find a benchmark! Stop thinking about the project. Others have thought of and practiced countless ways to make money you can think of. Find a specific benchmark and start imitating what you can imitate first.<br>Don’t be interested in Li Jiaqi at first. You can’t imitate it if you want to, and your ability and resources are not enough;<br>Small self media people like Uncle Wang are very easy to imitate; When Uncle Wang first started to do film commentary at station B, he also watched more and felt that he had this ability, so he had the idea of making video. Learning all the way, growing and changing benchmarking objects, has come to this day. “<br>He: “I see. Find the target! Thank you, Uncle Wang. This explanation is very grounded. A few simple words are worth more than the courses in 998 outside.” Then he sent a big red envelope.<br>I said, “I know how to be grateful and how to exchange values. Young man is valuable and has a bright future.”.<br>Author: Wang Shu official account: Uncle Wang notes</p>

          <p>These two days, the hottest event is the Winter Olympic Games. Even I, who usually doesn’t care much about winter snow sports, am also paying attention. Why? Because it’s very fresh, I haven’t seen many ice and snow sports. I don’t really want to go skiing. I haven’t experienced it. What kind of feeling is that. I believe most people, like me, are a little strange to ice and snow sports, but with the holding of the Winter Olympic Games, ordinary people like us gradually pay attention to ice and snow sports.<br>There are many opportunities derived from the Winter Olympics, take ice and snow sports for example. I believe that after the Winter Olympics, all ice and snow sports, some people began to try to learn, which is the germination of demand.<br>For example, at present, according to big data, the most popular sport is short track speed skating.<br>There is also a reason to be liked. What follows is that a large group of people want to learn short track speed skating. This prediction is not groundless, but supported by big data. According to Baidu Index analysis, nearly 100000 people are paying attention to this sport every day.<br>Before the Winter Olympics, about 3000 people were concerned every day. This shows that some people like this sport originally. With the holding of the Winter Olympic Games, this sport appears in front of more people, which also indicates that more and more people begin to try this sport. So where are our opportunities?<br>There are two ways:</p>
<h3 id="1-Direct-advertising-sales-tutorial"><a href="#1-Direct-advertising-sales-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="1. Direct advertising sales tutorial"></a>1. Direct advertising sales tutorial</h3><p>Ordinary people want to learn short track speed skating, and no one around them will. The best way is to find some information on the Internet to learn. At this time, we can sort out some information about short track speed skating collected on the Internet and pack it for sale.<br>There are many channels for collection, including existing books, videos and articles, which can be presented through the framework. Of course, there is still relatively little information about this movement on the Internet. Just because there is less information, you will have the first opportunity to do it. After all, all businesses are almost based on poor information. After finishing, we can complete a sales letter page like this and directly bid.<br>At the beginning, we haven’t reached the end of our psychology. We can set the sales price at 99 yuan. After the later sales are stable, we can slowly increase the price. This method is the most direct and simple. It can be effective immediately. The only thing that takes effort is to collect and sort it out.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-IP-long-term-operation"><a href="#2-Direct-IP-long-term-operation" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct IP long-term operation"></a>2. Direct IP long-term operation</h3><p>I personally prefer to do things with time compound interest. No matter what industry, it is suitable for vertical IP. We can output questions about short track speed skating through major we media platforms to obtain fans, such as:<br>These are a few questions I think of at random. One question is an article. You should know that there are at least tens of thousands of questions about short track speed skating. It is a process from scratch through the output of we media platform.<br>For example:<br>If we are in a classroom with 5 male students and 10 female students, the teacher asks us: what city is the capital of our country. This TM is a silly question. Everyone knows, but no one dares to raise his hand to answer. Why? Some people will think that the teacher’s question is definitely not so simple, while others will think “I’ll see if others raise their hands to answer”. At this time, you raised your hand to answer the question, the teacher praised you, and then you sat down. At this time, other students will certainly admire you. Why?<br>There are two reasons. One is to admire your courage. The other is that everyone knows that this knowledge has a sense of resonance. Many seemingly profound principles are actually a matter of one or two sentences. Doing IP is also a similar principle. Of course, we don’t need to focus on the sport of short track speed skating. We need to know that there are many ice and snow sports or other sports. If we find one we like and stick to it, we will certainly gain a lot.<br>Opportunities often come from life and attention. As serious as you are, the opportunities will be great.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</p>

          <p>However, there will be many choices in life. Whether the choice is greater than effort also depends on the time you make your own choice. In 2012, the official account and the official account number in 2020 were chosen. The two choice results are different. In the past few years, the official account was able to rise naturally to the point of explosion and light up the powder. Now choosing official account requires the output of various quality contents and drainage of various platforms. It is much more difficult than in previous years.<br>Standing on the tuyere, pigs can fly. Tiktok missed the 2017 sound, and don’t miss the little red book again! What the curator wants to share today is the complete analysis of xiaohongshu’s grass planting notes and drainage playing methods!</p>
<h3 id="About-little-red-book"><a href="#About-little-red-book" class="headerlink" title="About little red book"></a>About little red book</h3><p>Xiaohongshu first such a set of data at the will future brand conference for merchants on July 22.<br>I have to say that although there are many jokes about little red books, this huge flow pool can not be ignored!<br>The little red book platform also has the following three advantages that can not be ignored:</p>
<h3 id="Eight-precautions-for-xiaohongshu-account"><a href="#Eight-precautions-for-xiaohongshu-account" class="headerlink" title="Eight precautions for xiaohongshu account"></a>Eight precautions for xiaohongshu account</h3><ol>
<li>Account registration<br>Play any project must follow one machine, one card and one number. Tiktok, mobile phone, Kwai hung, the same three mobile phone operators can not use registration card! Don’t use the mobile phone that has operated the xiaohongshu account for the second time. If you use it for the second time, you can choose to restore the factory settings and brush the machine for re registration! If it is a little red book account that has been operated a long time ago and is not popular for a long time, re register!</li>
<li>The account number is painted with mutual powder<br>There must be no data maintenance operations such as painting powder, mutual powder and praise on the account. The check is very strict.</li>
<li>Don’t delete the published notes at will<br>Notes cannot be deleted or modified without violation.</li>
<li>Don’t publish grass planting notes frequently<br>Don’t always write soft text promotion, and send it in combination with other dry goods.<br>Two of the six notes are enough to promote products.</li>
<li>Do not publish the contents of other platforms to xiaohongshu<br>I will judge that the content of Xiaohong book is plagiarism. Those who have made Baijia, headline, big fish and Penguin should understand it.</li>
<li>Material infringement<br>Don’t use pictures without copyright, otherwise it will cause infringement.</li>
<li>Release notes at will if you don’t understand the rules<br>Pictures should not be too explicit. Pay attention to prohibited words, lucky draw forwarding, making money and taking a part-time job are strictly prohibited. Notes cannot contain words such as praise collection.</li>
<li>Resend notes<br>Don’t republish your notes, or you will be judged as plagiarism<h3 id="Basic-maintenance-number"><a href="#Basic-maintenance-number" class="headerlink" title="Basic maintenance number"></a>Basic maintenance number</h3>The ultimate purpose of number maintenance is to let the platform determine that we are normal real users, so as to allocate our basic traffic. If we do not carry out the step of number maintenance, it will be determined as machine number &#x2F; dead number &#x2F; marketing number by the system, so as not to give traffic or even limit some functions.<h3 id="Quick-title-writing-method-detail-processing"><a href="#Quick-title-writing-method-detail-processing" class="headerlink" title="Quick title writing method + detail processing"></a>Quick title writing method + detail processing</h3></li>
<li>Collection Title<br>When raising the number five days ago, you should collect and sort out the title of your peers’ explosive notes. It is best to sort out the titles of peers in the form of tables or memos. Facilitate the formation of a basic thinking habit. Read more and learn more to form your own title database. Non peer titles can also learn their forms of expression. While maintaining the number, we should also look at the reading points, likes and comments of our peers, so as to form a basic habit.</li>
<li>Write the details of the title<br>First, the number of words in the title should be controlled within 20, preferably 16-18. If the title is too long, it will be hidden, too short and difficult to express the highlights of the article. Appropriately add some emoticons to the title. The color and form of emoticons are novel, which can prevent readers from reading fatigue, increase the completion rate and reduce the jump out rate. Some figures should be added to the title, such as “Introduction to Qingdao tour on the 2nd”, “I did it this way, my skin is bright and white in a month” and “18 treasure apps used by Tsinghua Xueba”.</li>
<li>Skills of imitating titles<br>The titles of different explosive texts are combined. Don’t copy. You can look at your peers for imitation.

          <p>Attracted by the title? Haha, of course, this is not the title party. I did become an SEO for a website company that made millions in a month. Of course, I have left now. To prevent someone from saying that I am the title party and boasting, just put on a picture.<br>(Baidu applet background)<br>As for the website, it’s inconvenient to disclose. I can only tell you that it’s a domestic Top1 website about numerology. Since last year, website SEO is really not as good as before. You can see that many webmasters are beginning to complain. Next, simply share some experience with SEO Xiaobai, and the old bird can pass by.<br>As for those old domain name filing, don’t pull it. Since last year, if you want to do a good job in Baidu SEO, filing is indispensable.</p>
<h3 id="Details-really-don’t-matter"><a href="#Details-really-don’t-matter" class="headerlink" title="Details really don’t matter"></a>Details really don’t matter</h3><p>Many brothers who can’t do well in websites have such common problems. They like to download all kinds of so-called SEO courses and learn some so-called SEO details. The website was changed from east to West within a few days after it was launched, and another set was downloaded within a few days. They felt that they got the baby again and continued to toss their website. In the end, the collection began to fall, and the spider didn’t come<br>In fact, the details mentioned by Daniel really don’t play a big role. Don’t expect this small detail to bring you a qualitative leap. If you don’t believe it, go to some big stations. Do people do those details? Some big stations don’t even have a website map, and others are not well optimized. Of course, the website map is still useful, but it doesn’t play a great role. I just want to tell you that the details are really not very important</p>
<h3 id="Content-is-king"><a href="#Content-is-king" class="headerlink" title="Content is king"></a>Content is king</h3><p>Content is king. The word has been rotten, but I still want to say very much. Only by constantly producing good content, Baidu will like you and give you enough traffic.<br>So good content must be original?<br>No, no, no, if the positioning of your website is exactly what you are good at, there is nothing wrong with your original writing. But if it’s not what you’re good at, you write a pile for originality, and you don’t have to think about it. It must be a pile of garbage. There is little help for users. Even if users close it directly when they come in, it’s not a good content. It’s really better to directly collect other people’s professional articles.<br>There are even some trainings, which specially teach people to replace tools with synonyms or even integrate tools to piece together a pile of garbage content to cooperate with a large number of articles on old domain names. On the surface, it is a very original article. Is that useful? Yes, you can get a lot of traffic in the short term, but is your content readable? Although the traffic has been obtained in a short time, users click in and don’t need to think that 90% will jump away directly. A large number of users click in and exit in seconds. In a few days, your website will be 100% lower. This is Baidu’s click algorithm, because the current computer is not so intelligent and can’t identify whether the content is useful to users, so it can only be judged by users’ behavior, This is also why baidu can’t crack down on fast platoon.<br>I want to tell you that Baidu doesn’t care whether you are original or not as long as your content is helpful to users. So why does Baidu official emphasize originality? The answer is very simple. If Baidu directly tells you that you can collect pseudo original, who still produces content? Everyone has collected it. If everyone has collected it, there will be no new and useful content output. At that time, when users search, the content of Baidu is the same, and has not been helped yet? Who will use Baidu in the future? So Baidu is not stupid. It must be original. Of course, I can clearly tell you that you can collect and pseudo original, but there are methods.<br>How?<br>You are an expert in this field. This is just direct originality. If you are not good at it, you can directly capture Baidu’s spiders’ places, such as today’s headlines, or even official account. Of course, there is also pseudo original. Generally, pseudo original is synonym replacement, but the readability of this sub is not good. Let’s teach you how to pseudo original in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s talk about the beginning first. The beginning must be original and 100 words are required. As like as two peas, I love to start with the title of the article. For example, many people like this ending. For example, let’s take a look at the title of XXXX. Remember that it can’t be deliberately appeared. It can be replaced by another word.</li>
<li>Second, the content is to have both pictures and texts and clear typesetting. The first thing is to make users feel good, and the second is the content. The content of the text can be 40% original, and must be three paragraphs, and the content must be more than 600 words. In fact, all three paragraphs can be copied directly, of course, it’s best to integrate different sites, You can change the beginning and end of the three copied paragraphs into your own words. Of course, you’d better insert your own words in the middle.<br>Then you will certainly encounter some titles, which can be summarized in a few words. It is difficult to achieve 600 words. What should we do? To give you a way, I take the title “what does SEO mean” as an example. If I want to write this article, can I make this title clear in two or three sentences? It’s hard to put together three paragraphs and 600 words. What about the other two paragraphs? In fact, you can stand at the user’s point of view at this time. When users search for what SEO means, what will they search for next. The other two sub headings can be written with that. Of course, this can be seen through Baidu drop-down box and relevant search at the bottom. At this time, you can think about whether such articles are of very high quality?<br>What other people’s SEO means is only what SEO means, but we directly write out the content that users want to search next. The quality of the article can be imagined to be very high. If you still can’t understand the text, you can look at the picture I drew. It’s ugly. I’ll make do with it.<br>(demonstrate what the title SEO means and how to write the article)<h3 id="Regular-update"><a href="#Regular-update" class="headerlink" title="Regular update"></a>Regular update</h3>It’s difficult for us to pre publish a large number of new content through Baidu webmaster. Of course, it’s difficult for us to pre publish a large number of new content through Baidu webmaster. We have a lot of time to pre publish new content, So you only need to update regularly. I can tell you very clearly that spiders will crawl according to the update of the webmaster, so you must update regularly. Don’t wait for noon or night. In addition, it’s best to keep the day watch. You can write more articles when you have time. Sometimes you don’t have to worry about things at this time.<h3 id="Well-executed"><a href="#Well-executed" class="headerlink" title="Well executed"></a>Well executed</h3>Continuous updating is very important. In fact, SEO really doesn’t have many skills. The content is king. Just get the content done. Implement it well. The threshold for making money on the website is the most basic one year. Therefore, it’s normal for you not to make money before the website is built for less than one year. Make good use of the above methods to make content and Buddhist mentality. I believe you can optimize your own good website soon.<br>Author: Huang Bin official account: Huang Bin</li>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Yesterday, from the hot search list of microblog, I saw an interesting topic: what is high-quality sleep? When I opened it, I found that this topic was related to Gu ailing. She shared the secret of her success, that is, how to make her sleep for 10 hours every day.<br>As the saying goes, laymen watch the excitement while experts watch the doorway. A key word extracted from this topic is sleep, and a big demand derived from sleep is insomnia.</p>
<h3 id="01"><a href="#01" class="headerlink" title="01"></a>01</h3><p>Do so many people really have insomnia? I don’t count. That’s to be verified by big data. According to Baidu Index, the number of people who search for insomnia every day is about 3000-4000, and it has been so since 2011 and now 2022.<br>It can be seen that modern life is not easy. Due to various pressures, more and more people suffer from insomnia.<br>In order to confirm again whether there is a great demand for insomnia, search “insomnia” directly in Du Niang<br>Through the drop-down words, it is found that they are all the needs of poor sleep. What does this mean?<br>It’s very simple. It shows that a large number of people are searching for solutions in this field every day, otherwise they won’t appear in the drop-down box. Of course, if you want to solve insomnia, you must find a doctor. As ordinary people, of course, we are not doctors. Of course, we can’t solve the problem of insomnia for others. Most people think so. However, as marketers and entrepreneurs, we need more divergent thinking to consider. In fact, many times, we don’t need to completely solve the problem of insomnia. As long as we can alleviate it, there is a huge market.<br>There are many reasons for insomnia, such as cervical problems, promotion pressure, life difficulties, etc. insomnia caused by different reasons has given birth to corresponding products. Take the cervical vertebra problem as an example. The latex pillow was born. As long as you sleep, you can make the cervical vertebra more relaxed and comfortable and sleep better.</p>
<h3 id="02"><a href="#02" class="headerlink" title="02"></a>02</h3><p>Of course, for me, I prefer virtual products. What kind of virtual products can also improve sleep?<br>Its name is sleep music.<br>Maybe, many people don’t know that music can stimulate sleep. Let’s popularize science a little. One kind of music belongs to 432 Hz. This kind of music can heal the body and mind, let people get out of their emotions and make them more relaxed. When I am depressed, I will also listen to 432 Hz music, which can really make people empty.<br>In addition, according to the five elements and one theory left by our ancestors, the feather sound type also has the effect of improving sleep and nourishing the kidney.<br>The following is a general explanation of feather sound:<br>In order to derive whether there is a market for music assisted sleep, I conducted a relevant search in Du Niang, and someone was really advertising.<br>This shows that there is a special kind of people looking for this kind of music. When there is demand, the market is born, that is, opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="03"><a href="#03" class="headerlink" title="03"></a>03</h3><p>As ordinary people, how can we start this market?<br>Many times, we don’t need to tidy up. Many people have already done it. What we need to do is spend a little money to buy it. After we bought it, we sorted it out a little and easily had thousands of sleep music. The rest can be packaged into virtual products. Or you can put it into USB flash disk and sell sleep music USB flash disk. There are many examples, such as car music USB flash disk and so on.<br>A question + sleep music to help you. For example, users focus on what causes insomnia, so we can write a question or video about the causes of insomnia. Finally, plant insomnia music helps to improve the hook of sleep.<br>The title of the article can be: what causes insomnia? Sleep music helps you improve easily. For another example, the problem is insomnia, how to do? The title of the article is: what about insomnia? Sleep music helps you improve easily. In this way, the whole network is covered. Are you afraid of no traffic?<br>However, the problem actually comes from Baidu pull-down and 5118. When the traffic comes, it’s all loaded into wechat for transaction. OK, all the demands change and all the playing methods also change.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</p>

          <p>Although we always say that this is an era dominated by seizing public domain traffic, we still can’t completely deny the value of the website. Not to mention anything else, your other third-party platforms theoretically don’t belong to you. You only have the right to use them. If the platform thinks your operation violates relevant regulations, your account may be banned.<br>As for the relevant regulations and laws, it’s not the same thing. For example, if you talk about my account on platform a and platform B, it’s likely to be regarded as advertising by platform A. in fact, this is not a hidden rule of the industry. It’s already on the desktop. Many platforms directly say that the contact information of other we media platforms, especially competitive products, is not allowed.</p>
<h3 id="I-think-it-is-very-necessary-to-have-my-own-website"><a href="#I-think-it-is-very-necessary-to-have-my-own-website" class="headerlink" title="I think it is very necessary to have my own website"></a>I think it is very necessary to have my own website</h3><p>Building a website requires at least a domain name and a server. As we have said before, it’s good to choose Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei. Don’t go to Taobao to find small shops. You may run away and close down at any time. Don’t ask me how I know.<br>When buying a server, you should choose the cheapest new customer. Don’t ask what you can do if you can only buy it once. As long as you are not the monkey king, you must have parents, wives and children. Using their qualifications to buy it can save a lot of money. For domain name renewal, don’t be silly and renew directly. Learn to compare multiple platforms. If you are too lazy to compare, you can directly choose the cheapest platform. The question is, which platform is the cheapest? Remember, always another platform is cheaper.<br>For example, your current domain name is Alibaba cloud, a domain name with com suffix. If you pay the renewal fee directly, the price is 75 yuan.<br>Tencent cloud<br>If you transfer the domain name to Tencent cloud, the transfer price is 50 yuan, and it doesn’t count what other discounts you have, such as vouchers.</p>
<h3 id="Transfer-to-more-preferential-with-a-third-party-platform"><a href="#Transfer-to-more-preferential-with-a-third-party-platform" class="headerlink" title="Transfer to more preferential with a third-party platform"></a>Transfer to more preferential with a third-party platform</h3><p>Of course, what I’m describing here is not that Tencent cloud is more affordable than Alibaba cloud, but that instead of renewal, it needs to be transferred through a third-party platform. The extra time is no more than 1 minute, and the price can be saved by 25 yuan. Before your time cost of one minute does not exceed 25 yuan, it is recommended to save. Remember, face needs ability and money to set off. What is ability? Making money and saving money are both abilities. Lack of ability, face is a fart. With ability, face naturally exists.<br>Last time I talked about the topic of server purchase, I said that if you run out of new customer permissions for your immediate family members, you use those of your family members, and a friend said you’re sorry to open your mouth, I wonder. If you ask seven aunts and eight aunts to register for you, you can save 200 yuan and spend 100 yuan to buy him a box of milk and ten kilograms of eggs. Who will say you’re not good?<br>Finally, I wish you a happy New Year!<br>The 16th original content in 2022 can be reproduced and shared, but please indicate the author and source.

<li>Drainage to official account<br>I found that these official account numbers have their public numbers in the home page or comment area.<br>It is recommended that you do the copy number, drainage to the public number is better, drainage to the official account after the official account of the play has a lot of, here to introduce several:<br>(1) official account No.<br>After official account official account, we can start selling our public numbers after the official account has accumulated fans. Let’s see how much the price of this type of official account is.<br>An official account of 63 thousand fans is priced at 35 thousand, and the price of a single fan is around 50 Fen. The price is very good. After all, it’s powdered.<br>(2) Advertiser revenue<br>As long as our official account is full of 500 fans, we can open the traffic master, and users can get the revenue if they only watch or click on the advertisements in our articles.<br>The official account numbers of these copywriters are basically over 10 thousand. We calculate according to 10% of the reading number. According to the two yuan of the click price, the revenue of an article is about 2000 yuan. We have to send at least 30 articles a month. If so, the monthly income can reach 6W. But if you have about 150000 fans. However, fans of this kind of tiktok are still very simple in comparison with fans in other fields, and account fans who do a little bit more serious on the shaking are over 300 thousand.<br>(3) Tweet ads<br>In the later stage, advertisers will definitely contact us to launch tweet advertisements. The price of a 100000 pink copy number should be about 2000-3000, one for 24 hours. We connect three or four articles a month, and the income here is 10000 yuan. We can also go to some official account promotion platform to find advertisers and ask them if they want to advertise on our official account.</li>
<li>Knowledge payment<br>Now that someone is writing a copy number, there are bound to be some beginners who want to learn tiktok. At this time, we can make our own experience of shaking, and record it into a course, with a price of 699-999.<br>Like the above, he realized it by teaching others to make a copy number.</li>
<li>tiktok on cash<br>We can go to the star map to pick up some advertisements on the tiktok, or hang up some small programs to make money. Search the star tiktok directly, then enter, select the task you love, then follow the instructions above. If the above operation is troublesome, we can also sell the number directly,<br>You can see a 1.9W number, the price is 2800. It is very simple to make 20000 copies of this document number. It can be made 5-6 times a month, and the income is more than 10000. A normal vibrato, you send two works a day, at least two times tiktok, if not, then we must think about whether our content is a problem and how we need to adjust.<br>Finally, I think this project is very suitable for Xiaobai to operate. If we stick to it for three months, we can make a monthly income of 5000 +. Execution is in place, and you can earn more than 10000 yuan a month.</li>

          <p>Usually, it is almost impossible for a new site to get up in a few months if there is no high-weight old station to guide the external chain belt of the whole station. Of course, this refers to the means of white hat optimization. Is there a project that doesn’t need to rely on SEO websites to make money? The answer is yes, and such websites are also very profitable. They can earn more than 100000 yuan a month by simply receiving advertisements, which is comparable to color sites. What website is this?<br>The answer is tutorial sharing websites. At this time, someone will say that you just boast about X. In fact, the tutorial resource sharing websites I’m talking about here do not refer to those sites with VIP fees, but those completely free resource websites. Because these websites are free, users are usually very sticky. As long as you insist on sharing every day, these users will come every day and will be willing to take the initiative to help you promote.<br>Then you can earn 100000 a month for free? Don’t be kidding. Don’t worry. Let’s disassemble them one by one.<br>First of all, we can see that the website is full of advertisements, and according to my observation, the advertising space is full in a year. As for which website it is, I don’t say it here. I believe many people know which website it is. I went to know the advertising quotation about this website in advance. The following is a screenshot of the consultation.<br>Next, I can give you a screenshot of all the advertisements on this website.<br>Roughly, the advertising space alone earned 110000. At this time, it is estimated that someone will say that this website is the head. Only he makes so much money. In fact, it is not. As long as you search more, you will find that there are too many resource websites with full screen advertising. In addition to the advertising space, these websites also have another main way of making profits, that is, promotion. It is understood that the one-day IP of this website is about 50000-100000. We all know that a new promotion project comes out. It must be to see who grabs people first, and those who grab more eat meat. The rest may not even have soup. For example, take away CPS, Taobao customers, and even some mobile apps.<br>This project is so fragrant that I can’t let it go. After a period of testing, the website has hundreds of IP in the first month. How many pure white hat article sites can’t achieve in a year? At present, the IP that is stable at about 300 can occasionally go up to four or five hundred on weekends.<br>Now let’s share the operation process in detail.</p>
<h3 id="1、-Website-construction"><a href="#1、-Website-construction" class="headerlink" title="1、 Website construction"></a>1、 Website construction</h3><p>As for the construction of the website, it is recommended that you choose the program of zblog or WP. As for how to build the website, it is actually very easy. If you don’t understand, you can explore Baidu by yourself. There is not much explanation here. Of course, it is almost impossible for such websites to make money in the early stage, because you are completely free, mainly relying on the realization in the later stage. If you want to make money immediately in the early stage, you can consider making a charging resource station. The methods explained below are all general.</p>
<h3 id="2、-Resource-arrangement"><a href="#2、-Resource-arrangement" class="headerlink" title="2、 Resource arrangement"></a>2、 Resource arrangement</h3><p>If you want to make money from a resource website, it is a great test of your resource collection ability. How to collect it?<br>You can directly move peer resources, but peer resources generally have their watermarks. So it’s not recommended. Of course, as long as you look carefully, there are still some resource forums that don’t add website watermark, or their course watermark is easy to cover and won’t jump around. The second is to go to leisure fish or buy more resources. The third is to go directly to some Alibaba online disk resource forums. There is no recommendation here. You can search by yourself. According to my observation, there are still a lot of Alibaba online disk resource forums without watermark.<br>After you get these resources, all you have to do is download them, then add your website advertisements in the video or compressed package, and then upload them to the online disk to share. So how to add random jump watermark to the video? You can use PR or meeting sound and shadow here. However, these cannot be added in batch, which is a waste of time. Here is another artifact recommended to you, called EV video converter, but this one needs members. If it’s lifetime 188, the price is still very cheap. If you plan to be a resource station, you can consider buying one. After all, it can save you a lot of time.</p>
<h3 id="3、-Promotion-method"><a href="#3、-Promotion-method" class="headerlink" title="3、 Promotion method"></a>3、 Promotion method</h3><p>When your website is filled with certain content, you can start to promote it. After all, it takes a long time to get up by SEO, so we should take the initiative. How to promote it?<br>Is to add the resources of website advertising and distribute them to all corners of the Internet. How to do it? We go to Baidu search resources forum this keyword, and then find those forums that are not only posted by administrators, and then send them inside. After updating your website, you can synchronize to other resource forums immediately. In the early stage, as long as you can stand loneliness, you don’t need to be so tired after your daily IP comes up. Because at this time, netizens will take the initiative to help you promote, which may be to share or sell your resources, or recommend your website to his good friends. Of course, there are many channels. Let’s dig them out by ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="4、-Website-realization"><a href="#4、-Website-realization" class="headerlink" title="4、 Website realization"></a>4、 Website realization</h3><p>When you have a certain amount of traffic, you can consider cashing in. In fact, there are many ways to cash in. In addition to selling advertising and promotion projects, you can also set up a forum for netizens to exchange and share, and charge an invitation code. In addition, you can also open a public official account for Amway software. This time, you can directly send your official account to your website, and after all, you are sharing resources. Fans are still very accurate. The official account is official account. The public price is usually based on your reading. The 1 read 0.5-1 yuan. After reading the official account, there is a 1000 reading volume of a tweets after 10 thousand fans. In general, when you have thousands of powder in official account, people will continue to advertise for you. It is very easy to pick up 4 pieces a month, and that month will add 3000-4000 extra income. Of course, with the increase of your fans, the advertising quotation will naturally be higher and higher.<br>Author: Huang Bin official account: Huang Bin</p>

          <p>After the end of the year, the official commencement date. There will always be many opportunities in the new year, but it’s hard to say whether these opportunities are yours or not. However, there are always methods and laws. Laziness is human nature. It is the word laziness that brings many opportunities to ordinary people. Especially the beginning of the new year is your opportunity.<br>About laziness, I will directly talk about two points: 1. What is laziness like in life? 2. How to dig gold around laziness?</p>
<h3 id="1、-What-is-laziness-like-in-life"><a href="#1、-What-is-laziness-like-in-life" class="headerlink" title="1、 What is laziness like in life"></a>1、 What is laziness like in life</h3><p>Life needs to be plain and not plain. There are too many laziness in life, such as lazy boiling water, and the water dispenser helps you do it; Don’t bother to go out for dinner and have meituan takeout; Too lazy to read, there is Fandeng reading club; Lazy drainage, professional promotion company; Lazy mopping, intelligent mopping robots and so on, there are many, many lazy places, but it is because of these laziness that relevant opportunities and products have been born.<br>Therefore, no matter what happens, it has its two sides. What you see from different angles is different scenery. For ordinary people, laziness is not good. For entrepreneurs, the lazier the users, the better. In life, there are still many kinds of laziness. This is the opportunity. This will be the opportunity for you to increase your income in the new year. Don’t worry about what to do. When you can sort out 100 kinds of laziness in life, you will naturally know how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2、-How-to-dig-gold-around-laziness"><a href="#2、-How-to-dig-gold-around-laziness" class="headerlink" title="2、 How to dig gold around laziness"></a>2、 How to dig gold around laziness</h3><p>It is said that information gap is a business opportunity, which is true, but behind this information gap is the word laziness. Through laziness, we can always find many good projects and know the general direction. How can we dig for gold around this lazy word? In fact, as long as you have a heart, you will soon find that many cases have been made. What we need to do is to imitate these cases, copy and optimize them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Luminous balloon<br>When we go shopping, we can always see someone selling luminous balloons on the street. Children like it very much. A luminous balloon, about 6-10 yuan, feels acceptable, but we go to 1688 to search for it.<br>There are many similar, the wholesale price is about 1 yuan. At this time, interested people will come back from the wholesale website, wholesale some, and then go to places with a large flow of people to sell, selling 10 yuan each, 50 easy ones a night, with a profit of 7 yuan per balloon and 350 yuan, which is much better than going to work.</li>
<li>Accounting forms<br>Accounting is a profession specialized in accounting. The most frequent contact with this profession is a variety of statistical tables. If we say that every time we do account statistics, we need to make such a formatted form from scratch, it is also a troublesome thing.<br>Therefore, from the perspective of laziness, accountants need to find some ready-made style sheets to reduce the workload. Interested people collect and sort out a lot of accounting expressions through different channels, package and sell them.<br>Although it only sells for 1.98 yuan, it can’t afford a large amount. After that, this kind of virtual products often do the national market. They usually do a good job in drainage, and the profits are very rich. They are not restricted by logistics and collect money on the same day.</li>
<li>Plan<br>In the new year, when you start to work, you will always have to write some plans. The process from zero to some will be very big. Such a project operation plan<br>It also takes a lot of thought. At this time, laziness appeared again, so someone collected and sorted out the information of n-many relevant plans to sell<br>Sales are good. The people who organize make money, and the people who write the plan are lazy and successful. They have the best of both worlds.</li>
<li>Station B answer<br>I believe everyone has seen the video of station B. as long as you have registered its account, you will find that in order to successfully become a full member, you need to answer questions. To tell the truth, as long as you are patient, you can successfully answer questions and become a full member. However, there are a lot of people who are too lazy to answer questions, so someone began to sell products to help them do questions. This is also the demand derived from the users of station B who are too lazy to answer questions.<br>Through the above cases, we can find that as long as we can successfully find the laziness in life, we can create solutions. Laziness is the opportunity for us ordinary people. When you find 100 kinds of laziness, you have 100 opportunities to increase your income. You only need to choose what you like to do. In the later stage, you can directly refer to your opponents for how to drain and transform, because they have thought it out for you, so you just need to apply it. On the first day of the new year, I hope this article will inspire you.<br>Author: Zhou Dagong No.: Zhou dahengtong</li>
