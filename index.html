          <p>Starbucks, the “coffee giant”, has been on the cusp of public opinion recently.<br>First, on February 14, the topic of “Starbucks customer service responded that the police were driven away from eating boxed lunch at the door” was posted on the microblog hot search, which aroused heated discussion among netizens; Two days later, on February 16, Starbucks made headlines again because of the price increase. According to the official app of Starbucks, the prices of many products, including American coffee and latte, were 1-2 yuan higher than before.<br>Starbucks was once known as the ancestor of the coffee industry. It has been in China for 23 years. It has more than 5000 stores in more than 200 cities across the country. China has become its second largest market in the world.<br>Starbucks store, picture &#x2F; Starbucks China official microblog<br>However, the repeated negative social news and food safety problems have led many consumers to re-examine Starbucks. The coffee giant has slowly stepped down from the altar and lost its aura.<br>In addition, Starbucks has fallen into the situation of “surrounded by heroes” in China.<br>Before, Rui was lucky to save itself and rebirth, staged a reversal against the wind, and is becoming the most powerful challenger of Starbucks again. Later, new brands such as manner, m stand and three and a half tons rose rapidly with capital support. These local coffee brands attracted coffee users with accurate operation strategies, constantly introduced new products and flexible marketing methods, forming a trend of encirclement and suppression against Starbucks.<br>Starbucks’s “midlife crisis” has come.</p>
<h3 id="Collapsed-image-of-quality-life"><a href="#Collapsed-image-of-quality-life" class="headerlink" title="Collapsed image of quality life"></a>Collapsed image of quality life</h3><p>Since entering the Chinese market, Starbucks has always been bound with “high-end”. The high product price, unique coffee culture, atmosphere filled “third space”, coupled with the long-term publicity of the brand tone, have shaped the high-quality image of Starbucks in the eyes of consumers.<br>But today, the image of this quality of life is collapsing.<br>On February 13, a netizen tweeted that a Starbucks in Chongqing drove away the police who ate boxed lunch at the door and complained maliciously. In response, on the evening of February 14, Starbucks China issued a statement of apology through its official microblog. According to Starbucks China, at about 5 p.m. on February 13, four policemen came to the store, and the store arranged the policemen to eat in the outdoor guest area. Later, because other customers wanted to eat in the outdoor guest area, the store partner and the police involved caused communication misunderstandings due to improper words when coordinating seats.<br>Starbucks response, figure &#x2F; Starbucks China official microblog<br>Subsequently, the incident continued to ferment on the social platform, and Starbucks’ response also caused a large number of netizens’ dissatisfaction. Some netizens said in the comment area that “this statement seems to be a misunderstanding? Not an apology”, “China can have no Starbucks, but not without the people’s police”. Some netizens Amway have set up other coffee brands, Netizens expressed their dissatisfaction with Starbucks. According to the boiling point video report, a local citizen found that someone in front of Starbucks sent white flowers and threw rotten eggs on the floor. When the cleaners wanted to clean, they were discouraged from cleaning.<br>On February 16, Starbucks ranked first on the hot search list due to the “price rise”. The prices of many products, including American coffee and latte, have increased by 1-2 yuan compared with the previous ones. Taking the American style most often purchased as an example, in Starbucks app, the price of large American style was 28 yuan, but now it has risen to 30 yuan. In this regard, Starbucks stakeholders said that the pricing was made after considering a number of factors such as operating costs. From February 16, 2022, Starbucks will slightly raise the prices of some drinks and food in its stores in mainland China.<br>It is worth noting that this is the second price increase of Starbucks in four months. The last time was in October 2021, and the price increase was mainly on the food side. Meanwhile, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that due to inflation, rising labor costs and other factors, prices are expected to continue to rise in the coming months.<br>The price rise is superimposed with the public opinion crisis of “expelling the police”. No wonder consumers are targeting Starbucks. This is not the first time Starbucks has been deeply involved in the vortex of public opinion. Previously, Starbucks also caused many dissatisfaction due to the rejection of coins, food safety and other issues, which greatly reduced its corporate image.<br>In August 2020, an online blogger released a video in which the blogger planned to pay Starbucks orders with coins, which was rejected by store staff. The rejection of coins triggered a lot of heated discussion, pointing out that Starbucks was suspected of breaking the law. Subsequently, Starbucks China left a message in the comment area of the official wechat top article saying that there was no rule to reject coins and apologized for the poor experience of individual customers. However, at the bottom of the message, netizens said “this is really the most perfunctory explanation I have ever seen”.<br>In addition, at the end of last year, Starbucks was exposed to food safety problems such as using expired ingredients and selling overnight bread.<br>In December 2021, the Beijing News reported that when undercover in two Starbucks stores in Wuxi, they found the problem of touching the red line of food safety, including the expired use of a variety of ingredients. At the same time, the clerk would cover it up by tearing off or modifying the shelf life label; In addition, there are also problems in the store, such as wiping the trash can with the bar towel and continuing to sell overnight bread. In this regard, many netizens commented that “speechless, Starbucks uses expired raw materials for more than 30 cups?”.<br>Starbucks store, picture &#x2F; Starbucks China official microblog<br>After events, the halo of Starbucks gradually faded. On the contrary, “arrogance” has become synonymous with Starbucks.<br>In the “2021 China Coffee online comment Mining Research Report” released by ncbd (food treasure Dictionary), Starbucks received as many as 56% of the bad comments in terms of services, of which “arrogance” appeared the most.<br>Obviously, the rising product prices, the “black history” of using expired food and the “arrogant” service attitude make the quality of Starbucks products completely inconsistent with the product image and high-end brand positioning, and are also wearing away the loyalty of consumers. Its carefully shaped image of quality life is gradually collapsing.</p>
<h3 id="Starbucks-is-losing-Chinese-young-people"><a href="#Starbucks-is-losing-Chinese-young-people" class="headerlink" title="Starbucks is losing Chinese young people"></a>Starbucks is losing Chinese young people</h3><p>Today, China is Starbucks’ second largest market in the world. According to the annual report of fiscal year 2021, the Chinese market contributes 12.7% of Starbucks’ global revenue, reaching US $3.69 billion. In the financial report, Starbucks specially stressed that “China is our fastest-growing market and our second largest market.”<br>For this reason, Starbucks closed its stores in other markets while opening stores in the Chinese market against the trend. The financial report shows that as of January 2, 2022, the number of Starbucks stores in the Chinese market has reached 5557 and is accelerating to enter more cities. In fiscal year 2022, Starbucks plans to have 6000 stores in China and 230 cities.<br>Behind the crazy expansion, Starbucks is trying to hold the world’s second-largest market, but to continue to stabilize its performance, Starbucks may face a more thorny problem - losing Chinese young people.<br>Figure &#x2F; Starbucks China official microblog<br>On the one hand, Starbucks can dominate the global coffee industry by relying on classic products such as latte, cappuccino and furuibai. However, in recent years, it has not been able to capture the preferences of young consumers in terms of product innovation and marketing methods.<br>First of all, at the product level, Starbucks has no special hot models in new product research and development in recent years, and even has the situation of “rollover” of new products for many times. Up to now, the product that Starbucks can get out of the circle is xingbingle, which was launched many years ago.<br>In the summer of 2019, Starbucks launched eight “ice cream” series, but make complaints about the worst Starbucks. In the first half of 2020, Starbucks introduced other plant meat products such as lasagna and pasta through the concept of plant meat, but these products have also been blacklisted by many users. Even at the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, its new products are traditional classic series such as latte, cold extract and furuibai, without new actions.<br>On the contrary, Starbucks has been doing well around the brand. For example, in 2019, Starbucks launched the spring Limited “cat claw Cup”, and the price on the second-hand trading platform was even fried to nearly 1000 yuan. But it also inevitably raises questions, does this mean that Starbucks’ main business has begun to touch the ceiling?<br>On the other hand, with the upgrading of the demand of the new generation of consumers, the young consumer groups, the main force of consumption in the coffee market, have become more rational and mature, and gradually look at those once sought after foreign brands in a more objective way, including Starbucks, The younger generation of consumers have realized that Starbucks is only affordable coffee in many developed countries abroad, not “high-end” coffee.<br>If Starbucks was the only coffee choice for consumers in the past, then there are countless choices for consumers in today’s Chinese coffee market, and Starbucks is no longer the only one. According to the “Shanghai coffee consumption index” released by first finance and economics, Shanghai, as the main penetration place of coffee culture, has 6913 cafes, far more than New York, London and Tokyo. It is the city with the largest number of cafes in the world.<br>It can also be seen from the financial report data that the same store sales of Starbucks are continuing to decline. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, Starbucks’ same store sales in China decreased by 7%, while in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, the decline expanded to 14%.<br>Most importantly, when young consumers are faced with a variety of coffee choices, the reference factors are no longer limited to the freshly ground coffee culture. Cost performance, personalization, convenience and quickness are all the needs of young people. No matter from which perspective, Starbucks is no longer the best choice for young people of this year.</p>
<h3 id="New-coffee-players-encircle-Starbucks"><a href="#New-coffee-players-encircle-Starbucks" class="headerlink" title="New coffee players encircle Starbucks"></a>New coffee players encircle Starbucks</h3><p>Compared with Ruixing challenging Starbucks alone a few years ago, the competition in today’s coffee market is obviously more intense. Local coffee brands have sprung up, forming a trend of many new coffee players encircling Starbucks.<br>In 2021, the capital market accelerated the pace of investment in the coffee market, and the track is hot. Based on this, new coffee players are speeding up horse racing and enclosure.<br>According to the investment and financing data report of the five “new catering” tracks in 2021 released by qicha, the total amount of financing disclosure related to the domestic coffee industry was nearly 6 billion yuan in the first October of 2021. Popular brands such as sengine Yingji coffee, manner and M stand even got two or three rounds of financing in the first half of the year. In addition, there were three and a half, yongpu, algebraist New brands such as nowwa and Nova coffee are rising rapidly with the further boost of capital.<br>Overview of cash absorption of popular catering categories in October before 2021 &#x2F; report on investment and financing data of five “new catering” tracks in 2021<br>In addition, many cross-border players are eyeing the coffee track. For example, China Post officially entered the coffee market. The post office coffee landed in Xiamen International Trade Building and officially opened on February 14.<br>All these make Starbucks face unprecedented challenges in China. More importantly, Ruixing is reborn through self-help and staged a reversal against the wind, and is becoming the most powerful Starbucks Challenger again.<br>At present, Starbucks has lost its proud throne of “the first number of stores”. As of January this year, Starbucks has 5557 stores, while Ruixing coffee has exceeded 5671 stores in the third quarter of 2021.<br>Secondly, Ruixing, who is good at using the Internet, is better than Starbucks in product innovation and marketing.<br>In order to meet the preferences of young consumers, Ruixing can create popular products repeatedly while maintaining the high-frequency update speed. In the internal letter released by Guo Jinyi, it was mentioned that in 2020, Ruixing launched 77 new ready-made drinks and 113 new ready-made drinks in 2021.<br>Among them, the “thick milk latte” launched in 2020 is regarded as the heaviest new product to save Ruixing coffee in the industry; The “raw coconut latte” launched in 2021 is even more difficult to find. According to the data released by Ruixing’s official wechat, the “raw coconut latte” has created a single month sales volume of raw coconut series products of more than 10 million cups in June, refreshing the sales record of Ruixing’s new products; On the basis of raw coconut latte, Ruixing further developed and launched the “velvet latte”. Only nine days after the launch, the sales volume exceeded 2.7 million cups, becoming another popular model.<br>Ruixing had a financial fraud crisis, which is its “pillar of shame”, but also forced it to live on its own blood. Therefore, in terms of marketing, Ruixing also works very hard to find the preferences of young people.<br>In the summer of 2021, lilushu was selected by Ruixing as the recommender of Ruixing ice coffee due to the fire of the talent show “Creation Camp 2021”, and launched the first cooperative advertising film “Ruixing yyds”. Ruixing used lilushu’s own social topic gene to play with topics such as “raw coconut latte never leaves work” and continued to market products.<br>Recently, Ruixing is betting on Zhonggu ailing. In the sports event of the Winter Olympic Games, Ruixing attracts countless eyes through marketing means. On February 8, Gu ailing won China’s third gold medal in the women’s Freestyle Ski platform diving final of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. Ruixing immediately sent microblogging congratulations and launched a 4.8% discount coupon to invite users to “drink to the champion”. This wave of marketing has also won a good market response for Ruixing. Many customized products of Ruixing Gu ailing were once sold out. Drinking a cup of customized Ruixing of Gu ailing at one time has become a way for many netizens to celebrate.<br>In addition to Ruixing, the newly emerging concept of manner’s main boutique coffee is gradually moving from a 2 ㎡ small store in Shanghai to the whole country. Manner avoided the direct competition with Starbucks and other brands by choosing a location adjacent to Starbucks but at a lower price than Starbucks, attracted more heavy coffee users, and made manner succeed in breaking the circle among a number of coffee brands in a small but refined mode.<br>Manner coffee store, figure &#x2F; manner coffee official microblog<br>More importantly, the small and refined manner has good revenue. According to public information, since the accelerated expansion in 2019, manner has become the fourth brand in the number of chain boutique coffee stores in China, and all stores are directly operated. According to latepost, an investor said that manner’s revenue in 2020 was 200-300 million yuan, with a net profit margin of more than 10%, of which all stores in Shanghai were profitable. Meanwhile, manner’s gross profit margin is more than 50%, which is similar to that of Starbucks.<br>With the rise of boutique coffee brands such as manner and M stand, Starbucks is losing ground step by step under the encirclement and suppression of domestic coffee brands through different playing methods. The coffee track is surging, and a new round of fierce battle is about to be staged. Can Starbucks still sit in the position of “big brother”?<br>(the first picture of this article comes from Starbucks China’s official microblog.)<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:yikecaijing, and is published by the 36 krypton.</p>

          <h3 id="flee"><a href="#flee" class="headerlink" title="flee"></a>flee</h3><p>During the days of isolation on the high seas, Xue LAN, a crew member of the ocean spectrum, gradually got used to being fed and cared for like a giant baby. She went to bed from morning to night and lay flat completely. She didn’t think of eating until her limbs degenerated every time she slept.<br>For a moment, Xue LAN especially sympathized with the capitalists. Her salary was paid as usual, her meals were nutritious, and her spiritual life was well taken care of by various recreational activities. “I feel guilty watching thousands of employees queue up in the staff canteen on time every day, with big mouths open…”<br>Over the past few years, Xue LAN has served the 168000 ton cruise ship of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship. Ocean spectrum is also the only cruise ship deployed by this American cruise company in China to stick to Asian waters and wait for the recovery of China’s cruise market.<br>In February, Royal Caribbean, the world’s second largest cruise company, can’t survive.<br>Royal Caribbean recently announced that in view of the extension of Hong Kong’s epidemic prevention policy, it will cancel the “no destination” voyages of the remaining high seas tours in this quarter.<br>The cruise company said that canceling the rest of the voyage this season is the most prudent decision. It believes that under the current unstable situation, it does not want to put passengers in trouble. Passengers who have booked the voyage of ocean spectrum from Hong Kong will be given a full refund, including port taxes.<br>The ocean spectrum resumed its voyage to Hong Kong on October 14 last year. At that time, more than 1000 Hong Kong guests followed the ocean spectrum from Kai Tak wharf, opening a long-awaited cruise vacation life.<br>Royal Caribbean is full of confidence in the deployment of this 2-4 night high seas theme route until this spring, saying that “the smooth departure of ocean spectrum has brought positive signals for the recovery of China’s cruise industry.<br>By the time the “ocean spectrum” left Hong Kong, the cruise ship had successfully operated 20 voyages, received nearly 40000 local tourists from Hong Kong, and there was no new confirmed case.<br>However, the plan can not keep up with the changes. The ocean spectrum went to Hong Kong in advance, which means that the Singapore sea tour season, which was originally only started by Royal Caribbean from April to June this year, has been advanced.<br>“The ship may feel that Hong Kong should not stay for a long time. Before that, it was planned to go to the Singapore market in March this year,” Xue Lan said with great regret. “The Chinese market is good. It is not easy to have Hong Kong, but it is also too passive. A positive or several close connections will stop the ‘Maritime Hotel’ carrying thousands of tourists and crew.”<br>Not only the Royal Caribbean is suspended, but the Star Dream Cruise Line under Yunding Hong Kong also needs to temporarily stop the “high seas Tour” in response to the government’s epidemic prevention policy and continue to handle refunds for customers of affected routes.<br>The travel industry previously reported that Genting Hong Kong, which belongs to Xingmeng cruise, applied for provisional liquidation due to financial difficulties earlier. On January 28, it was announced that it would submit a liquidation petition for its Xingmeng cruise. It is unknown whether it will affect the voyage arrangement.<br>Costa’s 11 cruise ships will resume flights in 2022. According to its latest information, the latest plan includes a total of more than 1800 voyages from the spring of 2022 to the winter of 2022-2023, and there is no plan for China’s home port.<br>At the beginning of 2022, the short-term “no destination route” in Hong Kong came to an abrupt end.</p>
<h3 id="Switch-to-war"><a href="#Switch-to-war" class="headerlink" title="Switch to war"></a>Switch to war</h3><p>It has been a long time for clouds on the high seas. Xue LAN is looking forward to waking up one morning and hearing the captain’s kind voice, “Dear spectrum team, we have arrived in Singapore“<br>The time when the ocean spectrum arrives at the Singapore cruise terminal is expected to be at the end of February this year. In the eyes of the crew, this city is not popular. “Who is not more interesting than Singapore in Alaska, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the Caribbean? But I also want to go to Singapore. In this situation, I can’t help being picky“<br>On the occasion of the departure of the ocean spectrum, the fifth wave of the epidemic in Hong Kong has intensified. Singapore, which has a relatively open policy towards the epidemic, has become the plan B of international cruise lines.<br>In October 2020, the Singapore Tourism Administration announced that “no destination” cruise was allowed. At that time, the trial plan was limited to the world dream of Xingmeng cruise ship and the ocean quantum of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship.<br>However, in February this year, some sharp eyed tourists found that the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship, Princess cruise ship and exquisite cruise ship have begun to sell “destination” holiday accessories, that is, the round-trip trip trip from Singapore to other countries or regions.<br>“Destination” cruise vacation is expected to resume in Singapore at the end of the year, which means that tourists aboard Singapore may go to Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.<br>The Singapore Tourism Board said that pre-sale of tickets is a common practice, but this does not mean that Singapore has approved sailing to international destinations, but in Xue Lan’s view, this is a good omen.<br>According to the official website of Royal Caribbean International cruise ship, the ocean spectrum has 13 Asian trips to and from Singapore. The first flight is scheduled to start on October 21 this year. This five night trip to Malaysia passes through bason and Penang in Malaysia and Phuket in Thailand.<br>Similarly, the Royal Caribbean’s exquisite cruise ship acme is scheduled to set sail from Singapore on January 15 next year, passing through the port of linchaban in Bangkok, Thailand, Ho Chi Minh City, Nha Trang City, hue Da Nang and Hanoi City in Vietnam.<br>The Diamond Princess of Princess cruise ship has five Asian trips to and from Singapore. The first flight is scheduled to start on December 11 this year, a seven-day trip to Southeast Asia and the Malaysian Peninsula, passing through Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia, Phuket and Langkawi in Thailand, and then returning to Singapore.<br>Seeing the company’s plan, Xue LAN began to take notes of the countdown before arriving in Singapore on the calendar. She listed ten life goals such as “don’t stop learning” and “keep exercising every day” on a # self-discipline, that is, freedom # list. She expected to “decorate things into her mind before arriving in Singapore, otherwise she will only grow in vain.”<br>However, does the sale of the “destination” itinerary of the above three cruise ships mean that the three cruise ships have been allowed to resume flights in Singapore and the “destination” itinerary has been opened?<br>In an interview with Xinming daily, Chen Meiyan, the cruise director of the policy planning department of the Tourism Administration of Singapore, said that it is normal for cruise companies to release the shipping schedule for reservation in advance for commercial reasons, such as planning fleet deployment. However, this does not mean that Singapore approves cruise ships to international destinations.<br>Moving to Singapore in advance is the second choice for cruise companies in the Asia Pacific sea area, and the future of cruise companies still depends on local epidemic prevention policies.</p>
<h3 id="dilemma"><a href="#dilemma" class="headerlink" title="dilemma"></a>dilemma</h3><p>Unable to bear the repeated torture of the epidemic, some crew members chose to say goodbye.<br>Different from Xue Lan’s decision to continue to go to Singapore with the ship, her three good friends chose to go home early in Hong Kong. “I don’t give up, but I won’t exaggerate it. I just go to hug and say some blessings before queuing up to leave Hong Kong“<br>Since the outbreak, the Royal Caribbean International cruise ship has suffered losses for eight consecutive quarters, the industry is depressed, and the on-off and on-off among the crew is also common.<br>Royal Caribbean International Cruise Ship recently released last year’s annual financial report, which showed that the cruise company had a net loss of $5.3 billion, higher than the net loss of $3.9 billion in the same period last year.<br>Even so, Royal Caribbean is much better off than Genting Hong Kong, another major international cruise operator.<br>Yunding Hong Kong, the parent company of Xingmeng cruise, applied for liquidation on the 18th of last month because it failed to repay its due debts, and has appointed a joint provisional liquidator to assist in restructuring the company’s business. Therefore, Xingmeng cruise, its subsidiary, suspended the sale of new tickets from the 21st of last month for an initial period of two weeks until February 4.<br>The travel industry learned that as of press time, Xingmeng cruise has not accepted new ticket reservations until further notice.<br>30 years ago, Lin Guotai, chairman and chief executive of Genting Hong Kong, actively expanded the cruise business in Hong Kong in order to disperse casino risks and diversify business. In addition to acquiring American crystal cruise, he also established Xingmeng cruise in Asia and acquired German shipyards to build ships for the company, but he did not survive the epidemic after all.<br>According to the latest research, Hongkong was the most affected destination by COVID-19 under the impact of border closures, quarantine regulations and infection threats, and the performance of tourism decreased by 75% from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, Hong Kong’s tourism industry accounted for only 3% of GDP, compared with 12% in 2019, or US $45 billion.<br>At present, the Hong Kong SAR government adopts a “dynamic clearing” policy. Due to the gradual expansion of the fifth wave of the epidemic recently, the Hong Kong Executive Council recently decided to implement a “vaccine pass” from the 24th, and you can enter shopping malls and markets after showing it.<br>When the ocean spectrum left Hong Kong waters, Xue Lan’s biggest regret was that she had not visited Causeway Bay and Repulse Bay hotels. She remembered the road leading to Repulse Bay in Zhang Ailing’s love for the city. There were dense mountains and high cliffs on the left and blue-green sea on the right.<br>“But then I thought I had visited many places in Hong Kong, so I closed my mouth wisely“<br>Xue LAN has straightened out her mind and understands that it is not easy for the epidemic to dissipate, so she doesn’t say anything about “what I want to do after the epidemic”. She puts the matter of buying a house before the age of 27 on the agenda. “When there is a deep obsession, the money will be saved“<br>All respondents in this article are pseudonyms<br>*Disclaimer: under no circumstances shall the information or opinions expressed herein constitute investment advice to anyone<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:lvjienews, which is licensed by the 36 krypton, a platinum bag.</p>

          <p>On February 7, the famous leisure snack brand Yanjin shop announced that based on the recognition of the company’s long-term value and confidence in the company’s future development, the shares held by Hunan Yanjin shop Holding Co., Ltd. will be extended for another two years.<br>It is worth noting that previously, on January 19, Yanjin shop announced the termination of the shareholding increase plan. The actual controllers, some directors and senior executives of Yanjin shop originally planned to increase their holdings by no less than 50 million yuan, but actually increased their holdings by only 12.5487 million yuan, which actually completed only 25.1% of the original shareholding increase plan.<br>Executives directly broke the deal to increase their holdings, causing extreme dissatisfaction among shareholders. As of February 14, 2022, the share price of Yanjin shop has fallen by 24% this year, and the share price has halved from the highest point in 2020.<br>From the soaring stock prices in 2019 and 2020 to the falling stock prices today; From the increase plan to “empty check” to extending the lock-in period, a series of operations of Yanjin shop reflect the process of enterprises from development and growth, to weak growth, and then to innovation and change.<br>Yanjin shop is not the only one facing the bottleneck of development. The three squirrels, a snack giant that started with internet marketing, not only went on a hot search due to the non-compliance and controversial advertising pictures, but also suffered a reduction in holdings by major shareholders.<br>Why can’t the Internet traffic of leisure snacks run? What common problems does the industry face? How will enterprises see and break down their moves?</p>
<h3 id="Drifting-dividends"><a href="#Drifting-dividends" class="headerlink" title="Drifting dividends"></a>Drifting dividends</h3><p>In the golden decade of the Internet, many industries have hitchhiked the rapid development of e-commerce and also achieved rapid expansion of scale. As a member of traditional retail, snack food can be said to be the leader in the “east wind”.<br>According to the Research Report of BOC securities, from 2013 to 2020, the compound annual growth rate of offline sales of leisure food reached 9%; The compound annual growth rate of online sales scale exceeds 45%. The increasing popularity of online shopping and the rise of e-commerce promote the rapid development of online channels of leisure food.<br>However, there are also several joys and sorrows in the snack food camp.<br>Since the beginning of Yifen, for example, the former leaders have lost their team in the wave of e-commerce. According to laiyifen’s financial report for the first half of 2021, online e-commerce channels account for only 12.9% of its total revenue.<br>In sharp contrast, three squirrels and liangpin store accounted for 70% and 52% of online revenue respectively.<br>Although Baicao flavor first opened offline stores, its sales increased significantly after its transformation to online stores in 2010, with an annual sales growth of more than 4 billion yuan and a sharp increase in revenue of more than 100 times.<br>In fact, as early as 2011, laiyifen began to layout online channels, but the result was “getting up early and catching up late”. Due to over reliance on its own applications, Laifen did not invest too much resources in the third-party platform, which naturally missed the dividend period of e-commerce.<br>With the penetration of the Internet approaching its peak in China, the curtain of the golden decade of e-commerce is slowly falling, and the future development will change from the previous high-speed growth period to a stable maturity period.<br>From the tiktok of Taobao to the present situation of Taobao, Jingdong, spelling and meet as equals, the trend of Internet centralization is inevitable. Similarly, snack brands will also adapt to the new pattern in the era of traffic decentralization.<br>In short, the good days are over, and the bad days are still ahead.<br>Tiktok Kwai, who has ploughed Taobao and Jingdong, has launched three groups of squirrels, including the rapid distribution of the fast track, the sound of live broadcasting, the group purchase, the selection of the group, the purchase of vegetables, the optimization of orange hearts, and so on.<br>According to the three first year of the squirrel’s earnings report, the number of new business operators, such as jitter, and so on, the total revenue of the new business is nearly 10%. The total revenue of the new business is tiktok, which is nearly 10%. At the same time, its promotion fee and platform service fee increased by nearly 51% year-on-year, but the drainage effect is much worse than before.<br>The company said that online platform traffic was further dispersed, and multiple traffic entrances led to a decline in the traffic of mainstream e-commerce channels and a slowdown in the growth of online sales.<br>In the future, whether online or offline, it is unrealistic to travel around the world on one leg. The new retail mode of online and offline integration will be the future development direction of the snack industry.<br>At the autumn sugar and Wine Fair in Tianjin in 2021, three squirrels announced that they would focus on offline distribution channels and plan to achieve a revenue target of 10 billion yuan in five years.<br>Zhang Liaoyuan, CEO of three squirrels, once said that the online efficiency of brands is the highest from 0 to 1, because what you see is what you get; However, the probability of people’s life radius is still offline. If you want to make the brand from 1 to 10, you still get offline.<br>Since 2020, three squirrels starting from second and third tier cities have begun to layout the third to fifth tier sinking market.</p>
<h3 id="Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war"><a href="#Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war" class="headerlink" title="Health food encirclement and suppression war"></a>Health food encirclement and suppression war</h3><p>In the era of material scarcity, snacks give people the meaning of “delicious”. The satisfaction of taste buds has become the only standard to define whether a snack brand is qualified or even excellent.<br>Who ever thought that one day, “too delicious” will eat back the brand itself?<br>“Too delicious” often means sweet and salty. In other words, there are too many seasonings and additives in food.<br>When people’s material life is rapidly enriched, consumers’ demands have also jumped from simple “delicious”. As an important part of determining health, diet began to develop in a healthier direction.<br>Delicious food is no longer the highest goal pursued by diners, and even most people are willing to give up the enjoyment between lips and teeth for health. As a result, sugar free, less salt, non fried, vegetable meat, these words stand on the capital highland with healthy food.<br>The change of consumer concept indicates the subversion of industrial logic. Members in the industry are powerless to change. Just like the original Internet trend, if they can’t ride the wind and waves, they can only be submerged in huge waves.<br>In order to get rid of consumers’ inherent impression that traditional snacks are “not very healthy”, snack brand giants have played a “health card”.<br>For example, liangpin shop has launched a high calcium bar of bovine colostrum. 90% of the raw materials are whole milk powder, and the other 10% are bovine colostrum, natural sugar substitutes, dietary fiber, etc. it is a real healthy food; In 2021, Jiajia food will clearly focus on resources and build “salt reduction” into a large single product at the strategic level; One of the new product R &amp; D ideas of Shuanghui development is to develop low-fat, low sodium and other new products around functional health food.<br>However, it is not easy for the traditional snacks of “halfway monk” to seize the healthy track?<br>First of all, the first mover advantage of healthy food has basically been occupied by major healthy food bosses.<br>The products and marketing strategies of these brands are more targeted, and have established strong reputation advantages and fan resources. It is not easy for new brands to attack the city and pull out the stronghold.<br>Secondly, how to balance the development of traditional snacks and healthy snacks is a difficult problem.<br>For example, consumers have deep-rooted impressions of traditional snacks, and it may take a long time to do a good job of ideological guidance for consumers. It is necessary for enterprises to consider whether they can lose one wing or not.<br>The road to health is not easy.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-arm-survival-unknown"><a href="#Broken-arm-survival-unknown" class="headerlink" title="Broken arm survival unknown"></a>Broken arm survival unknown</h3><p>As an industry with low threshold, the competition of leisure snack industry is like a wolf. It’s no exaggeration to say “ten snack brands and nine nuts”.<br>In order to avoid homogeneous competition and forced to fight a price war, high-end seems to be the only way for head players.<br>According to the data of China National Business Information Center, the year-on-year growth rate of all channels in the high-end snack market in 2020 was more than 10%, far exceeding the growth rate of 6% in the overall snack market.<br>Although the development of snack categories is relatively simple, too many single items will still cause a heavy burden on the supply chain. A large number of SKUs will bring more capital risks to the brand and dilute the brand assets, resulting in problems such as increased costs and decreased gross profit margin.<br>In addition, the OEM model used by many snack brands is more likely to increase doubts about food safety and quality in front of hundreds of SKUs.<br>If we want to focus on the development of high-end lines, it means the integration of existing product lines.<br>In October 2020, three squirrels decided to cut down 300 SKUs, which is equivalent to half of the SKUs at that time. The three squirrels started the slimming plan mainly because the sales volume of these SKUs did not meet expectations and the input-output ratio was not high.<br>In the future, the three squirrels plan to transform from a full category brand to a brand of “nuts and dried fruits + selected food”.<br>Coincidentally, the high-end evolution of Yanjin shop is also in progress.<br>Different from the OEM mode of liangpin shop, three squirrels and other head leisure snack brands, Yanjin shop controls the whole chain of R &amp; D, production and sales. Founder Zhang Xuewu once told the outside world that he wanted to create a “Huawei in the snack industry” through his own unique model.<br>In 2021, Yanjin shop will also shrink its categories, including new products such as coke fish tofu, COD tofu, crab fillet and fish intestines. At the same time, it is planned to make baking, deep-sea food, spicy brine and dried fruit the forefront of the industry in the next 2-3 years.<br>Of course, the high-end road is not easy to go.<br>In recent years, although it still holds the top position of leisure snacks, the gross profit margin of the three squirrels has declined year by year, even worse than the average level of the industry. With the trend of diversified snacks gradually emerging, it may be difficult for the three squirrels to return to their peak market share.<br>In order to achieve high-end achievements, the R &amp; D expenses of liangpin store increased from 24.38 million yuan in 2019 to 33.71 million yuan in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 38%, and continued to increase year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2021.<br>From the perspective of product lines, liangpin store launched the children’s snack brand “liangpin snack Fairy” and the healthy substitute food brand “liangpin Feiyang” respectively in 2020. However, in the first half of 2021, the sales of xiaoshixian accounted for only 4% of the total revenue, and Feiyang accounted for only 2%.<br>It can be seen that leisure snack brands are still in the sowing stage of high-end upgrading war. You can only get if you can give up, but whether you can really get something after you give up remains to be verified by time.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>Although there are three leading enterprises such as squirrels and liangpin shop, the pattern of China’s leisure food industry is still very scattered. In terms of retail sales, the proportion of Cr5 in the industry in 2020 is only 10%.<br>As emerging brands such as Wang Yanfu and Shizu are favored by capital, the new forces are coming in one after another, and the white hot internal war in the industry is still intensifying.<br>Due to the low threshold and high degree of homogenization, “being imitated all the time” is an inevitable law in the snack industry. Whether it can “never be surpassed” will be the most important issue for each brand.<br>Whether it is healthy, high-end, or the decentralization of the Internet, we have to go. In the historical process of industry change, only by accelerating the pace and walking in the forefront can we have a greater chance of winning. As a foodie, we just need to taste delicious food and watch the surging of snacks in the Jianghu.<br>The picture comes from the Japanese drama “weight loss rebound”<br>Come on, what snacks do you usually like to eat?<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat’s new retail business review (ID:xinlingshou1001).

          <p>Health care, semiconductors and new energy, which are hot investment tracks in 2021, not only continue to reach new financing highs in the primary market, but also perform well in the secondary market.<br>After reviewing all the public data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2021, I found that the science and innovation board is gradually forming a cluster effect on the relevant tracks, and has given good returns. According to my incomplete statistics, a total of 162 enterprises landed on the science and innovation board in 2021, distributed in many fields such as medicine and health, semiconductor, information technology, production and manufacturing.<br>Tian Xuan, vice president of Wudaokou School of finance of Tsinghua University, also said that there are more emerging high-tech enterprises in the above fields, which also reflects the transformation of China’s capital market from traditional cyclical enterprises to high-tech, high-tech and hard core technology enterprises.<br>Taking the medical track as an example, 38 pharmaceutical and biological companies were listed on the science and innovation board in 2021, which is much higher than 28 in 2020 and 14 in 2019. Among the 38 enterprises, there are not only star innovative pharmaceutical enterprises such as Baiji Shenzhou, industry leaders such as Weigao orthopedics, but also many subdivided fields such as chemical agents, in vitro diagnosis, medical equipment and vaccines.<br>Hubble investment has also reaped five IPOs. The ones listed on the science and innovation board in 2021 are canqin technology, Dongxin shares and Juguang technology. In addition, it also includes sirip, which was listed in September 2020, and Tianyue advanced, which was listed in January 2022. The book returns brought by these five IPO projects have reached more than 6 billion yuan, more than twice the total size of the fund.<br>At the capital level, the 162 companies listed on the science and innovation board raised up to 202.9 billion yuan, higher than the gem and the main board, of which the gem was about 147.5 billion yuan and the main board was about 184.7 billion yuan. The scientific innovation board is playing its unique charm.</p>
<h3 id="Pharmaceutical-companies-flocked-to-the-scientific-innovation-board"><a href="#Pharmaceutical-companies-flocked-to-the-scientific-innovation-board" class="headerlink" title="Pharmaceutical companies flocked to the scientific innovation board"></a>Pharmaceutical companies flocked to the scientific innovation board</h3><p>In the context of the epidemic, the medical and health industry is hot all over the world. According to the statistics of data company innovative, excluding the SPAC part, the total number of global IPOs in 2021 is 2097, and the proportion of the medical and health industry is about 15.8%, second only to technology.<br>The same is true of the performance of the science and innovation board. In 2021, 38 pharmaceutical and biological companies were listed on the science and innovation board, which is much higher than 28 in 2020 and 14 in 2019. Among the 38 enterprises, there are not only star innovative pharmaceutical enterprises such as Baiji Shenzhou, industry leaders such as Weigao orthopedics, but also many subdivided fields such as chemical agents, in vitro diagnosis, medical equipment and vaccines.<br>In these segments, innovative drugs and medical devices perform well. Among them, Baiji Shenzhou is one of the leading companies in China’s innovative pharmaceutical enterprises, and is the world’s first three listed A+H+N company. Its main business is research, development, production and commercialization of innovative drugs, raising about 22 billion 200 million yuan, more than second and Optoelectronics combined with third times.<br>Of course, at present, the share price of Baiji Shenzhou also remained depressed after the first day of listing. As of February 21, 2022, a total of 182 companies on the science and innovation board have announced the performance forecast for 2021. Among them, three of the top five listed companies with the largest losses are in the pharmaceutical industry, and Baiji China bears the brunt.<br>Some analysts said that this is related to its high R &amp; D expenses, and when to make a profit has become the first problem in front of Baiji. Nevertheless, experts commented that Baiji Shenzhou has created many industry precedents. Among many biotech companies, Baiji Shenzhou is still one of the most likely to be upgraded to big pharma.<br>When it comes to Baiji Shenzhou, we have to mention the layout of strategic capital in innovative medicine. Hillhouse capital has accompanied Baiji Shenzhou for nearly eight years. It has not only participated in round a and round B financing, but also in the strategic financing after listing. It is the only leading investment investor of Baiji Shenzhou in China, covering the whole life cycle.<br>In addition to Baiji Shenzhou, Gaoling also invested in three innovative drug enterprises in a row, namely Hengrui, Xinda and Junshi biology. Hillhouse capital’s shareholding in these PD1 companies increased from 0.6% to nearly 10%. It not only invested a lot, but also invested in the top four of the track.<br>Li Xiaoyan, a well-known institutional investor, told me that in the A-share market, the listing of a large number of innovative pharmaceutical enterprises is no longer scarce, and capital is also paying continuous attention. At the same time, the licensing and cooperation of innovative pharmaceutical projects between China and countries around the world are becoming increasingly active. “However, China’s basic research is still weak, the homogenization of drug research and development is serious, and a large number of them are still in the clinical stage.”<br>However, with the good performance of the secondary market, the pace of innovative drug research and development is bound to accelerate, which will also shorten his whole life cycle. Investors who hit many medical and health enterprises also include Yida investment, Qiming venture capital, Junlian capital and Lilly Asia Fund.<br>Song Qinghui, an economist, also said in an interview that as an R &amp; D driven industry, the pharmaceutical and biological industry is in line with the positioning attribute of the science and innovation board. Compared with traditional pharmaceutical enterprises, innovative pharmaceutical enterprises will be recognized by the market in the future, and the price valuation will be higher and higher.</p>

In other words, the cluster effect of Kechuang board on semiconductor enterprises has appeared. According to incomplete statistics, in 2021, a total of 20 enterprises registered on the science and innovation board, and many enterprises started listing counseling.<br>Behind these semiconductor enterprises, one investor silently harvested three IPOs in a year, which is Huawei’s Hubble investment. In 2019, Huawei broke the principle of “not investing in suppliers” and registered its subsidiary Hubble investment to make large-scale investment in the semiconductor industry chain. After several capital increases, Hubble investment has a registered capital of 3 billion yuan.<br>According to my incomplete statistics, Hubble investment has now reaped five IPOs. Those listed on the science and innovation board in 2021 are canqin technology, Dongxin shares and Juguang technology. In addition, it also includes sirip, which was listed in September 2020, and Tianyue advanced, which was listed in January 2022. The book returns brought by these five IPO projects have reached more than 6 billion yuan, more than twice the total size of the fund.<br>Canqin technology, which was listed in November 2021, is an important supplier in the upstream of the global 5g industrial chain. It is used for the reception, transmission and processing of RF signals. It is widely used in the fields of mobile communication, radar and RF circuits, micro communication navigation and positioning. The company’s largest customer h and its enterprises under the same control contributed 91% of the revenue. It is speculated that Huawei is the company. Hubble’s investment in canqin technology was 110 million yuan, with a return of 2.8 times.<br>The Dongxin shares listed in December were invested by Hubble in May 2020, and now the shareholding ratio is about 4%. Dongxin semiconductor is a memory chip design company. Its products are used in 5g communication, Internet of things terminals, consumer electronics, automotive electronics and other fields. With the same torch technology listed in December, Hubble took shares in the pre-C round in 2019. Its main products are high-power semiconductor Aurora components and Aurora components upstream of the laser industry.<br>It is reported that the investment return multiples of Dongxin shares and Juguang technology are more than 8 times.<br>In addition to Hubble, the institutions that hit relevant enterprises in the semiconductor field include SMIC Juyuan, Walden International, etc. SMIC Juyuan is the joint management team of SMIC international, which was established in 2014. Walden International has also been along the industrial layout of semiconductors and is a professional investment institution focusing on the industry.</p>

There are more than 30 investors standing behind it, including Xiaomi Changjiang industry fund, Shenzhen Venture Capital, Lenovo venture capital, GAC capital, Guoke investment, etc. This is a supplier of consumer polymer soft packed lithium-ion batteries. In the field of power batteries, it has also entered the supply chain system of many well-known automobile enterprises.<br>Other energy track enterprises also include xinfengguang, boliwei, xiatungsten Xinneng, Changchang lithium, etc. It can be seen that the new energy industry chain will have “enrollment” opportunities in subdivided fields, including photovoltaic, energy storage, lithium battery, hydrogen energy and terminal applications.<br>Some investors believe that the whole new energy track investment is in a business cycle, and there are various types of capital in the upstream, middle and downstream.<br>Zhu Jia, partner of Lightspeed China, mentioned in an interview, “Taking the lithium battery industry chain as an example, the upstream materials of lithium battery, including its positive electrode, negative electrode, diaphragm and electrolyte, involve a lot of technological innovation, and the ultimate goal of innovation is to continuously improve the energy density of lithium battery, improve safety and prolong the number of cycles, so this is a field with very intensive technology.”<br>According to the data of BP world energy statistical yearbook, China has the highest carbon emission in the world by 2019; From 2015 to 2019, China’s carbon emissions grew at an average annual rate of 1.2%, exceeding the global level of 0.8%. China needs to make more efforts than developed countries such as Europe and the United States to achieve carbon peak in less than 9 years and carbon neutralization in the next 30 years.<br>At the same time, China’s new energy investment has reached its first climax since 2016-2017 and its second climax in the past two years. There is an important reason. The development of new energy is gradually getting rid of the previous government’s consistent subsidy model. Today, the market is gradually accepting the development of new energy industry, reducing costs and increasing consumption willingness, The whole industry has entered a positive cycle.</p>

IPO continued to grow by 13% on the basis of the fund-raising peak of 480 billion yuan in 2020.<br>Among the 524 IPO companies in 2021, there were 199 IPO companies on the gem, 162 IPO companies on the science and innovation board, 122 IPO companies on the main board and 41 IPO companies on the Beijing stock exchange. The number of IPO companies in the two innovation sectors accounted for 69% of the total.<br>Among the investors behind 162 enterprises, Shenzhen Venture Capital ranked first with 10 hits, involving intelligent manufacturing, new generation information technology, energy, medicine and other industries. In addition to Shenzhen Venture Capital, Yida capital, Tongchuang Weiye and Honghui fund also performed well.<br>Five of the ten enterprises - Jiulian technology, yahuilong, Qipai technology, Yingke environmental protection and Huayi technology all entered in the early a-round or angel round.<br>Taking Anlu technology as an example, Shenzhen Venture Capital once said in summarizing the logic of investing in Anlu technology that “what the country needs, what Shenzhen Venture capital invests”. In 2019, Shenzhen Venture Capital conducted a detailed industry research around the “made in China 2025” strategy and found that there was a phenomenon of explicit graphics card neck in FPGA chips in China’s chip segmentation field. At that time, foreign enterprises occupied about 90% of the domestic market. In the process of combing the industry, Anlu technology was seen and invested by Shenzhen Venture Capital.<br>Born in Jiangsu high tech investment group, Yida capital is one of the earliest provincial equity and venture capital institutions in China. At present, Yida capital has a cumulative fund management scale of 115.5 billion and more than 1000 investment projects. Founded in June 2000, Tongchuang Weiye is the first batch of professional private equity investment companies in China, with assets of more than 20 billion yuan and more than 400 enterprises. Honghui fund was founded in July 2014 by Wang Hui, the former investment partner of CDH investment and a member of the investment committee.<br>Zheng Weihe, chairman of Tongchuang Weiye, also said when referring to the investment theme of 2022, “in the capital market, the head institutions of the primary market accelerate the development, especially the head institutions of RMB; foreign capital GP is RMB; it is a trend to invest early and small, invest in hard technology and invest in biomedicine; the premium effect of popular industries in the secondary market brings greater arbitrage space to the primary market.”<br>What cannot be ignored is that according to the data of Oriental choice, there are 17 listed companies known as the “meat grinder” of the science and innovation board, whose share prices broke on the first day of listing, and the share prices have continued to fall so far.<br>Perhaps, this year’s sci-tech innovation board can give a clearer indication of investment.<br>For more details, please refer to the following table:<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:China-Venture, the author: Li Tongwei, 36 krypton authorized.</p>

          <p>A dream.<br>On February 21, the day after the Winter Olympics, Migu video fell to No. 52 in the free app list (iPhone end) of Diandian data platform.<br>This is still the result of the short rise after the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. On the day before the closing ceremony, Migu video has fallen to No. 88, and the ranking tends to return to about 200 before the Winter Olympics.<br>Before that, Migu video had just spent two weeks of “suddenly like the spring breeze of one night”.<br>On the first day of spring and the opening day of the Winter Olympics, the dau (number of daily active users) of Migu video increased by 2.7 million. In the subsequent schedule, its dau remained at about 11 million, almost double that before the Winter Olympics. From February 5 to 9, in the general list of Diandian data free app (iPhone), Migu video jumped from the top 200 to the second, followed by the central video.<br>The reason for topping the list is simple: Migu video and central video are the only platform for “two” users to watch the whole live broadcast of the event on the mobile terminal. Compared with the central video, Migu video also has one more hand - Wang Meng, a former Olympic champion and now a Winter Olympic commentator with “eyes like a ruler”.<br>However, as the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, the number of users of Migu video began to decline. On February 9 and 11, its daily life fell by 11.26% and 11.24% respectively… Until it returned to the situation before the Winter Olympics before and after the closing ceremony.<br>This scene also appeared at the 2018 World Cup. In 2022, after the warm wind at the beginning of spring, will Migu video go out of the cycle of ending the season and maintaining the same traffic?</p>
<h3 id="01-Migu-video-performance-competition"><a href="#01-Migu-video-performance-competition" class="headerlink" title="01 Migu video performance competition"></a>01 Migu video performance competition</h3><p>In the broadcast “field” of this winter Olympic Games, Migu video has almost no opponent like existence.<br>Migu video is one of the few “players” who can stand on the field according to whether they have the broadcasting right or not.<br>The central television broadcasting station said in the statement of copyright protection of Winter Olympic Games: the video platform that won the broadcasting rights of this winter Olympic Games is only three Kwai goo videos, Tencent and fast hands. Further observation will show that Tencent and Kwai have only the right to live broadcast live, that is to say, if you want to watch the live broadcast of the whole event, the mobile terminal users have only two choices: Central video (CCTV) and Mi Gu video.<br>Facts have proved that the two platforms did have bright data after the Winter Olympics. Baidu Index shows that since February 4, the search indexes of both have increased significantly and remained at a high level for several days. During this period, the search index of “aiyouteng” three platforms was flat or decreased. Little data shows that the estimated downloads of Migu video increased by 13.5 times month on month in the first week of the Winter Olympics.<br>In the second step of seizing the leading position, Migu video relies on explaining this card. During the Winter Olympics, former Olympic champion Wang Meng, who served as Migu video commentary, repeatedly boarded the microblog hot search and contributed golden sentences such as “my eyes are feet”. On the day after Wang Meng finished his last interpretation of the Winter Olympics, as of February 17, the total number of topics read by microblog # Wang Meng interpretation # reached 2.67 billion, exceeding 2.57 billion of Gu Ailing’s gold medal.<br>Wang Meng’s out of the circle has also further driven the data growth of Migu video. Many users said in the comment area that “because of Wang Meng, Download Migu video and recharge members”. Coincidentally, the two significant increases of Migu video Baidu Index also appeared on the day after Wang Mengyin explained the circle, one of which was “my eyes are feet”, and the other came from a clear and clear explanation of the reasons for the foul committed by Hungarian players in men’s short track 1000m speed skating.<br>The share price of China Mobile, the gold owner behind Migu video, was also boosted. On the day Gu ailing won the gold medal on February 8, the A-share price of China Mobile once rose by more than 6%, and the first week of the Winter Olympic Games rose by 15.68%.</p>
<h3 id="“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast"><a href="#“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast" class="headerlink" title="“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast"></a>“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast</h3><p>The sports broadcasting business that Migu video has bet heavily is actually a hard bone that many platforms can’t attack for a long time.<br>LETV sports, Suning sports, Tencent video and Sports Olympic power were all important players on the card table. In October 2014, when the broadcasting rights of sports events were liberalized, the momentum of the Olympic Games was 8 billion for the 5 years, the most colorful footnote in the market bubble.<br>However, the high copyright fees and slow and rare returns of sports events have also become a heavy burden on video platforms. Sun Hongbin, an investor of LETV sports and founder of rongchuang, once said at the 2016 performance conference that “LETV spent 1.35 billion last year (2016) and only received 50 million in total.”<br>Finally, the platforms with heavy positions in sports broadcasting rights may be dragged down, or choose to shrink the cost and protect themselves.<br>Migu video has been able to carry it up to now, due to its ingenious admission time, the financial and technical support of China Mobile behind it, and a lighter operation mode.<br>In 2018, when the video came into the market, the market bubble of sports copyright had gradually dissipated, and copyright prices had dropped sharply. Wei Jianglei, former senior vice president of sina.com, said in an interview with the media at the end of 2017: “on the whole, the copyright price is much lower than the high point, and the gap is three to five times.”<br>If the good admission time makes Migu video account for “Tianshi”, the support of the parent company China Mobile has created a “favorable location”.<br>From the perspective of financial strength, Migu video, backed by China Mobile, has obvious financial advantages compared with other platforms, which has also become the foundation for it to buy a large number of sports copyrights.<br>Supporting Migu video’s entry into sports broadcasting is also in line with China Mobile’s own development interests. In its music, video, reading and other businesses, sports event broadcasting is obviously the best way to give full play to its 5g network advantages.<br>In addition to the support of the sponsor, Migu video also makes careful calculations on the cost side - different from the self built studio and self broadcasting of sports live broadcasting platforms such as Tencent live broadcasting and PP live broadcasting, the outsourcing of broadcasting work is Migu’s “magic weapon” for saving money.<br>Southern Weekend quoted a number of insiders as saying that after purchasing the copyright, Migu did not broadcast directly by itself, but outsourced the broadcasting work to a third-party company. The latter adds the live room signal, loads the subtitles, and then pushes it to Migu platform. In other words, Migu video only provides a viewing platform. This method saves the cost of equipment and equipment during the live broadcast period, such as the cost of special personnel and effective maintenance.<br>Different from the careful calculation of broadcasting, Migu video has been laid out in the field of interpretation for a long time, and has always been a great deal of investment in the interpretation team. This is also the background of the “Wang Meng phenomenon” in this winter Olympic Games.<br>Last year’s Tokyo Olympic Games, Migu video invited more than 100 hosts and guests, including 30 well-known sports commentators, 12 Olympic champions and 20 world champions. The interpretation team of the Winter Olympics is even better, with more than 150 commentators and guests.<br>In addition, in the selection of commentators, Migu video has formed its own playing method - try to choose popular guests who are easy to break the circle or bring their own traffic to explain. Wang Meng, who made frequent golden sentences, Chen Chen, the track and field commentator known as the “human computer” at the Tokyo Olympic Games, and Lu Han in the European Cup final.<br>Having tasted the dividends brought by the “interpretation circle” for many times, Migu video prepared the live broadcast team of this winter Olympic Games early. Wang Meng was one of the first guests invited by Migu video. In January this year, Migu video went online to select the variety “boiling! Commentator” for sports commentary, so as to reserve strength for its commentary team. Wang Meng participated in it at that time.<br>Relying on the deep interpretation team, Migu video further strengthens the interaction between users and the platform. In the Winter Olympics, Migu provided a variety of interpretation combinations for users to choose from, and even specially set up Cantonese interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="03-a-game-a-dream"><a href="#03-a-game-a-dream" class="headerlink" title="03 a game, a dream?"></a>03 a game, a dream?</h3><p>But the story of users leaving the game after the game is repeated.<br>With the Winter Olympics coming to an end, the download volume of Migu video has continued to decline, even lower than the average value in recent months from February 12 to February 19. It seems that with the end of Wang Meng’s interpretation, the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, and users are gradually “leaving” from Migu.<br>This is reminiscent of the ups and downs of its past events. According to the annual report of China Mobile, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, 4.3 billion people watched the game through Migu video client. However, the monthly active number fell by 11.35% in the four months after the event. In the month following the end of the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, the monthly activity of Migu video fell by 32.28%.<br>The situation of heavy gold and water is also happening in Kwai Fu. Kwai tiktok is the only platform to get the right to broadcast and return the Winter Olympic Games in the short video platform. However, in a number of media reports, Kwai 2 billion 500 million has been betting on the two Olympic Games (Tokyo Olympic Games and Beijing Winter Olympic Games).<br>The strategy adopted by Kwai in this winter Olympic Games is to upload and replay, and update the old ways of medal list and schedule in time. But tiktok, which is the short video platform, has been overtaking by tiktok, relying on the introduction of sports stars. Especially the early popularity of Gu Ailing and Su Yi Ming has greatly boosted the activity of the jitter during the Winter Olympics. During the Winter Olympics, the downloads of the Kwai Po were even lower than January’s average downloads.<br>Just like the fast hand picked the wrong operation strategy, there is obviously a shortage of the long video strategy of the microkwai video.<br>At present, Migu, standing on the video platform track, chooses the strategy of focusing on sports and supplemented by film and television dramas. But the question is, during the off-season, what does Migu video take to retain users?<br>At present, Migu video platform is like a collection of major video platforms, presenting content from Mango TV, iqiyi, Tencent video, etc. This may be related to its strategy of purchasing copyright from other platforms. In November 2021, Migu video also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with mango hypermedia with a cooperation amount of no less than 3.5 billion yuan within three years.<br>However, from the playback volume data, users are still more inclined to chase dramas on the original video platform.<br>Obviously, non exclusive content can make up for the shortcomings of Migu video in the content pool, but it can not distinguish Migu video from other video platforms. As a result, Migu video is like the user’s “monthly throwing” app, which is “abandoned” by the user immediately after the end of the competition for one to two months.<br>From the perspective of event broadcasting rights, Migu has few hands, including the broadcasting rights of Qatar world cup from November to December 2022 and China Asian Cup from June to July 2023.<br>For Migu, sports copyright has proved to be an excellent breakthrough direction, but it is not a bottomless moat. After all, it is the event itself rather than the platform that attracts the audience.<br>Relying on the rich and powerful gold owner, it is true that he can get a good hand of cards, but after the cards are played, for Migu video, which is absent in the field of entertainment, variety, film and television and other original content, how to retain the influx of users during the season is a beautiful problem that needs to be considered most.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:xuebaocaijingshe, and is published by Gao Xuyang, 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>E-commerce platforms and logistics companies have been “in love and killing each other” for a long time.<br>The rise of e-commerce has promoted the rapid development of the express market towards maturity, and the industry has gradually cleared up. Small express enterprises have exited one after another. In this process, the reconstruction of the supply chain by e-commerce mode has reduced the cost of logistics in commodity sales and further suppressed the profitability of express.<br>However, logistics is also the lifeblood of e-commerce. The reason is that e-commerce must eventually fall to the stage of competitive services. The timeliness of distribution and terminal distribution capacity related to terminal services determine that logistics has become an important link connecting consumers.<br>The above “competition and cooperation” relationship has been highlighted in the development of e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, jd.com and pinduoduo.<br>Tiktok is a situation of tripartite confrontation between overweeningly ambitious businesses and the need for logistics.<br>Recently, the voice of the tiktok has been distributing frequently. It is said that according to a person close to byte beat, byte has completed its investment in polar rabbit express to supplement the e-commerce puzzle and expand the layout of overseas e-commerce.<br>It is self-evident that the message is not true, but the position of bytes to make up logistics services is self-evident. Tiktok said.<br>In addition, in January 12th, according to media reports, the voice tiktok opened the test express service “Yin Zun Da”, providing door-to-door service. It is reported that the service has been experienced by some merchants.<br>From these actions, the pace of building e-commerce closed loop is accelerating.<br>For e-commerce platforms, there are two ways to supplement logistics services:<br>First, build a self built logistics platform, and then replace the original third-party services; Second, it is highly integrated with the information system of logistics partners to improve operation efficiency and reduce operation costs.<br>In China, JD chose the self operated mode, while Alibaba chose the integrated mode.<br>Since rookie is the only way to build a closed loop for e-commerce, there are also rookies and Jingdong pearl Yu before. Then, which way will tiktok e-commerce choose? Or is it a self reliant Mountain Gate?</p>
<h3 id="01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease"><a href="#01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease" class="headerlink" title="01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease"></a>01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease</h3><p>Last August 1st, Zhang bought a garment on the tiktok platform, and the company promised to deliver the goods within 7-10. But wait until the 10 showed the delivery information. He could not wait to check the order again. He found the order showed that “your parcel is being blocked because it is being blocked.”<br>At that time, Zhang felt quite strange. On the premise that he did not receive any express, and in the previous communication with the express company, he did not mention rejecting the express, so the package was returned for no reason.<br>Zhang hang then dialed the manual customer service number of the express company that delivered the goods. The customer service showed that the merchant intercepted the express delivery, resulting in the return of the package.<br>Tiktok, who was unhappy, came to the shaking platform to find out the problem of the artificial customer service, but the way of dealing with the other side was not satisfactory. He only proposed the way to compensate tens of dollars of coupons. Through this, Zhang kept hesitating about shopping on the tiktok platform.<br>Meanwhile, Li Hong, who sold ceramic products on the shaking platform, received 6 tiktok notices in 9 days. The reasons for the violation were the exception of the express order or express logistics track uploaded to the background.<br>Li Hong’s shop was also punished accordingly. A total of 4000 yuan of deposit and 30 points of store credit were deducted. The shop was closed for three days.<br>In this regard, Li Hong felt very aggrieved. After all the orders in the store were real delivery, repeatedly communicated with the customer service to ask how to appeal, and applied for a sealed certificate from the logistics network, the appeal still ended in failure.<br>Up to now, Li Hong still cannot accept the above punishment.<br>An independent e-commerce department was established in 618 in 2020, followed by the external chain removal activity; And then tiktok payment on-line, shaking tiktok completes the payment closed loop; And even put forward the concept of interest in electricity providers, impact trillion GMV, the voice of the voice tiktok into a public eye in a vigorous gesture.<br>But now, whether or not it is admitted, logistics has gradually become the Achilles heel of the tiktok electric provider.<br>Tiktok itself is aware of this. Official data show that the distribution of service delivery problems in the tiktok and the express delivery service account for more than 50%.<br>In addition, the problem of terminal delivery can directly affect the user shopping experience, and will further affect the user’s repeat purchase. It will have a negative impact on businesses and users. This may be partly because of the fact that the chattering has been a tight lipped answer to the tiktok rate.<br>Tiktok, however, is considered to be generally weaker than expected in the near term.<br>Tiktok, raise a Babel of criticism of the noisy service, the company will provide door-to-door delivery, terminal delivery, terminal complaints, parcel priority transfer, exclusive service and other benefits.<br>Through these measures, tiktok intention reduces the rate of complaint and reversion rate of consumers.<br>According to snow leopard financial services, at present, Yin Zun Da is still in the water trial state. The voice only recommends that merchants buy some Yin Yin for some orders, and the recommended proportion is no more than 3% of the tiktok per day.<br>It should be noted that in this link, although the shaking is raising the importance of the terminal delivery, the initiative of the business lies in the business. In fact, whether the service premium is borne by the tiktok, whether the subsidy is transferred to the consumers, or whether the business platform will be transferred to consumers, needs further observation.<br>More importantly tiktok is essentially a service launched by tiktok and express delivery companies such as Zhong Tong, Tantong, rhyme, etc., and the jitter only plays a role in resource integration, and its intervention capability on the express platform is weak, and the effectiveness needs to be tested.</p>

After the group visit, President Kang Zeyu said that at present, the voice business is not doing warehousing, logistics, nor has it planned to build warehousing and logistics itself.<br>But Kang Zeyu’s denial cannot stand up in the face of facts.<br>Today, on the official recruitment website, there are 74 positions related to “logistics”, including R &amp; D, operation, product and functional positions, involving e-commerce supply chain, logistics middle office and other fields.<br>For rookie tiktok, logistics is very necessary, but there are rookie and Jingdong pearl Yu in front:<br>The former is positioned as a social logistics integrator based on Alibaba retail platform, which complements an important link in Alibaba’s performance network by integrating express companies and route transportation enterprises;<br>The latter is positioned as an integrated logistics service provider, which has established its own supply chain service advantages in the mode of warehouse distribution, and user experience has become its core competitiveness.<br>Therefore, “copying homework” has become a ready-made shortcut.<br>In May 2021, according to Tech planet, the voice and electricity business of logistics tiktok came to many former P9 supply chain &#x2F; logistics personnel. The new ones who left the company from Ali were Wang Wei, Ou Liyong, He Chuan.<br>Rookie tiktok logistics business is coming to the rookie logistics as it is visible after the P talent is coming.<br>Tiktok, tiktok, tiktok tiktok, a video of the voice of the business platform, was circulated online on the beginning of August. The screenshots showed that the sound of the quiver will be fully encrypted from August 1st.<br>As the initiator of electronic face list, Alibaba led many express companies to establish a logistics service provider “rookie network” in 2013. In May of the next year, all express companies accepted the public electronic face list platform launched by rookie network.<br>Of course, Jingdong and pinduoduo have also launched their own electronic face lists in the follow-up. Therefore, this measure can be regarded as a standard configuration to protect users’ data privacy.<br>However, what deserves more attention is the capital layout of byte itself in the field of logistics.<br>On August 25, 2021, byte established two logistics companies, one named Shanghai Daoqu Yuedong Logistics Technology Co., Ltd. and the other is Shanghai Xingchen Yuedong Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. their business scope is related to goods warehousing services supervised by the customs.<br>In the first few days of the same month, byte invested in zongteng group, a global cross-border e-commerce infrastructure service provider, which mainly provides overseas warehousing and other services for cross-border e-commerce merchants.<br>In addition, it also invested in three logistics robot Enterprises: Jiazhi technology, future robot and syrius Juxing.<br>On the one hand, it is internal incubation, on the other hand, it is investment at the same time, which is similar to the logic of rookie’s asset layout - self support as a supplement, investment as the main, investment in major logistics enterprises, layout of warehouses, and mastering the big data of sales and logistics.<br>Rookie’s tiktok network is more likely to rely on the Internet mode of rookie if it takes into account the recent market crazy “tiktok” has completed the investment in the rabbit express, and the integrated voice service of the United States express company.<br>This seems to be in line with the mainstream thinking. For the tiktok electricity supplier, if it imitates Jingdong logistics, it is undoubtedly very difficult. Jingdong Logistics asset construction costs a lot. In order to implement the logistics construction idea of integrating Jingdong warehouse and equipment, the volume of Jingdong fixed assets and projects under construction is different from that of general logistics enterprises.<br>But Kwai Kwai Kwai logistics has been ahead of the tiktok, Zhang Yipeng, who was responsible for the sales center of the fast hand business in January 2021, told the twenty-first Century economic report that “no quick self service supply chain planning is built in the short term.”<br>On the whole, the voice business is trying to make up the logistics puzzle, which is a tiktok question. But the answer it gives is slightly old-fashioned and childish.<br>(all characters in the text are pseudonyms)<br>reference material:<br>Snow leopard financial services tiktok’s logistics disease: last mile of the fire<br>Tech planet “exclusive voice tiktok personnel Transformation: domestic and international zoning management, introducing Ali high P overweight supply chain”<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:baoliaohui.

          <p>Truth social, a social media company founded by former US President trump, officially launched in Apple’s App Store late Sunday. From the software interface released by users, the user interface style of truth social is very similar to that of twitter. The bottom bar has four functions: information flow, search, private message and message. In the personal page, there are three dynamic categories: truth, truth and reply, and media, which correspond to Twitter’s tweets, tweets, replies, and media respectively.<br>From the pictures released by netizens, we can see that the number of registered people exceeded 100000 shortly after the opening of download. One night later, on Monday morning, the app surpassed HBO max, tiktok, youtube, instagram and Facebook to become the top 1 app download in Apple store. However, truth social encountered difficulties on the release date. Some users were unable to register, and some users received error messages. But for others who subscribe to the app, it will be automatically downloaded to their Apple device.<br>Related stocks dwac phun<br>Trump uses the platform as a substitute for social media giants twitter (Code: TWTR), Facebook (Code: FB) and Youtube (GOOG, Googl). On January 6, 2021, Trump’s Twitter, Facebook and tubing accounts were permanently blocked after Trump’s supporters caused riots in the US Capitol.<br>Trump media and Technology Group (tmtg), the venture capital company behind truth social, is led by Devon Nunes, a former Republican congressman in the United States. Nunes said on February 20: “our goal is to fully operate in the United States at least by the end of March. I think we can achieve this goal.”<br>Although the source of funds of the company is unclear, tmtg plans to be listed in New York through merger with spac digital world acquisition (Code: dwac). Upon completion of the transaction, it will receive $293 million in cash held by dwac in the trust, less any shareholder redemption. Last December, tmtg also raised $1 billion in committed financing from private investors, which will be put into use after the completion of the dwac transaction.<br>As part of the partnership signed in December, rumble will provide video and streaming services to true social. Rumble has always been regarded as a substitute for Google’s YouTube. Rumble’s investors include famous conservative venture capitalists J.D. Vance and Peter Thiel.<br>Truth social can only be used on Apple’s IOS system. Users in the UK and other countries are told that they cannot use the app in their region.<br>The logo of this application has also attracted the attention of trail, a small sustainable transportation company in the UK, which is investigating the similarities between the brand of truth social and its own brand.<br>A spokesman for the UK company said by email: “trail has no affiliation or contact with the truth social website.

          <p>(Li Yipeng)<br>The continuous emergence of new crown transmission makes nucleic acid detection become people’s “Daily”. In addition to the routine hospital laboratory, many people are also exposed to ICL (independent clinical laboratory) for the first time due to nucleic acid testing.<br>As a “behind the scenes” link in the medical industry chain, ICL has come to the front because of the new crown. In the process of expanding from b-end to C-end, digitization has become a necessity.<br>ICL was first born in the United States in 1925. With the increasing demand for medical testing and the increasing number of testing items, hospitals alone can not meet the needs in terms of testing efficiency and types. Independent medical laboratories with outsourced testing services as the core help medical institutions improve testing efficiency through large-scale operation.<br>In the medical insurance reform in the 1980s, ICL achieved rapid development due to its significant cost-effective advantages. According to public data, in 2018, the ICL market penetration in Japan reached 67%, Europe 50% and the United States 35%.<br>In China’s medical field dominated by public hospitals, the non-profit business nature and institutional factors make most of the tests still completed by the laboratory department in the hospital, so the penetration rate of ICL is only 5%. This not only shows that ICL still has broad market space, but also means that the traditional model of serving hospitals alone is difficult to achieve rapid growth.<br>Dean diagnostics, founded in 2001, is one of the main players in the field of ICL in China. Its business scope covers diagnostic services, sales of diagnostic products, technology R &amp; D and production, health management, cold chain logistics, judicial expertise, cro and other fields.<br>After the call of “all tests should be done, and all tests are willing” was put forward in April 2020, Dean diagnostics spent seven days to build a 1200 square meter “Reddy” rapid testing laboratory that can detect 70000 cases a day, raising the single day testing of its Hangzhou headquarters to 100000 cases a day. According to the data released in July 2020, the amount of nucleic acid detection undertaken by Dean diagnosis after the outbreak accounted for one tenth of the national total at that time.<br>While undertaking social responsibility, “war epidemic” gives Dean diagnosis the opportunity to directly face the public with testing needs. However, for a company that has always been facing the b-end market in recent 20 years, it is not easy to join to C service.<br>In the previous testing outsourcing services, ICL institutions only need to arrange regular door-to-door collection and delivery of samples, laboratory testing and remote delivery of reports. The business process is short and the number of customers is small, which makes the process docking and service difficulty of to B business relatively controllable.<br>However, in the c-end-oriented testing service, it is not only necessary to build a testing site, but also the institutions must be responsible for the testing appointment, information registration, report push and other processes, which has increased the complexity several times.<br>Prior to this, Dean diagnostics, like many national companies, had the situation that the IT systems and data of the group and local branches were not interconnected and partially relied on manual forms. When facing a large number of C-end customers, the ability of data flow, management and service has become the biggest bottleneck.<br>Digitization is therefore a must.<br>In 2020, Dean diagnostics introduced the CRM system based on SaaS mode and connected it with OA, MDM (Master Data Management), LIMS (Laboratory Management), customer service, decision-making, finance and other systems to realize the integrated management of internal data of the enterprise.<br>This not only ensures the end-to-end service capability, but also greatly improves the efficiency of the original business. The service processes and test data of b-end customers such as hospitals, CDC and physical examination institutions have been integrated and precipitated, and the efficiency of information flow has been improved, so that patients can receive test reports earlier and start diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.<br>Another urgent gap is customer service.<br>Compared with b-end services, C-end users have more consulting demands. After starting to provide testing services to the public, the number of telephone consultations for Dean diagnosis has increased several times. The sporadic outbreak in 2021 increased the pressure on the customer service team.<br>To this end, Dean diagnostics also introduced the full scene intelligent customer service system udesk under vofeng technology to respond to users’ common problems faster in the way of AI robots.<br>In addition to integrating external technologies, Dean diagnostics is also constantly building its own digital capability, and on this basis, it will expand to C services beyond New Crown detection.<br>In May 2020, Dean diagnostics launched the third-party online Internet inspection platform “Xiaofei inspection”, which directly faces the C-end users, and provided the supply chain, information, diagnostic services, products and channels originally built for medical institutions to the public.<br>Based on the “Xiaofei test” platform, C-end users can independently make an appointment for more than 60 test items, such as hpv23 genotyping gene test for women, accurate screening of AMH ovarian function and early screening of colorectal cancer, covering the whole population of women, men, children and the elderly.<br>At the celebration of the first anniversary of Xiaofei inspection, Chen Haibin, chairman of Dean diagnostics, evaluated this service platform facing the C-end as an important part of digital reform. CEO Huang Baixing said at the event that to C business will become the third most important growth curve of Dean diagnosis after general inspection and special inspection.<br>While supporting new services, digitization is also becoming a breakthrough for Dean’s diagnostic to B business.<br>In November 2021, Dean diagnostics announced the launch of the laboratory management system iris LIMS. Compared with the traditional inspection information system, the management of iris LIMS covers all elements such as people, instruments, materials (reagent consumables, etc.), processes, data (detection methods, laboratory links) and can support hundreds of thousands of samples and thousands of people in chain laboratories to cooperate across regions at the same time.<br>In the same month, Dean diagnosis was recognized by the Department of science and technology of Zhejiang Province and selected into the “Key Laboratory of digital medical diagnosis technology of Zhejiang Province”. Years of data accumulation will also provide assistance for the breakthrough of diagnostic technology.<br>With the per capita GDP exceeding 10000 US dollars, the medical demand in the Chinese market will change from “quantity” to “quality”, and better medical experience will become the inevitable direction. Whether in the user service experience layer or the technological breakthrough itself, there has been a digital figure.<br>At the strategic level, Dean diagnosis has set itself the goal of “industrial digitization and digital industrialization”. Chen Haibin, chairman of Dean diagnostics, said at the “Dean day” in 2021 that in the future, collecting samples from hospitals, laboratory testing and providing diagnostic solutions around disease diagnosis and clinical connection should be combined with the application of AI, artificial intelligence and other digital technologies.<br>“The future of Dean diagnosis must be a medical big data company. We will receive a large number of samples every day. How to use massive data to create infinite value for customers is what we need to study and realize in the future.” Chen Haibin said.</p>

          <p>The Beijing Winter Olympics has come to a perfect end, and people are still talking about the “legend” of the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the athletes who have repeatedly achieved good results, the biggest winners this year are the sponsors and brands that invite athletes to speak for them. With Su Yiming’s victory last week, “Yuanqi forest won hemp” once rushed to the hot search. The reason behind it is that the three spokesmen signed by Yuanqi forest won the championship at the Winter Olympics.<br>In this regard, Yuanqi forest ridiculed itself as “blessed”, and took the opportunity to open a limited edition beverage lottery, which successfully filled the marketing atmosphere.<br>What benefits did the vigorous forest of “winning the bet” get in this event?</p>

The new spokesman, Yiyang Qianxi, signed the new year’s signing of the two films, including the water gate bridge of the long Jin lake and the “miracle kid”. It has earned the market attention. In the first new year’s drama, the “yuan C” is the “Yuan”. The sports stars who successively signed at the end of last year detonated hot spots at the Winter Olympics. A series of performances make people sigh and wonder: why is Yuanqi forest so lucky all the time?<br>No one is a born gambler, and vitality forest is no exception. The so-called good luck is nothing more than “survivor bias”.<br>As an emerging beverage consumer brand, Yuanqi forest can become popular in a short time, which can be understood as the result of its massive investment in marketing. After combing the marketing actions of Yuanqi forest in recent years, it can be found that Yuanqi forest can be seen on social grass planting platforms such as xiaohongshu and microblog, as well as variety shows and online dramas on major platforms.<br>In addition to online channels, offline channels such as elevator advertising, offline small event sponsors and convenience store freezers are also key strategic targets of Yuanqi forest. The net is wide enough to catch some shining fish.<br>But the vitality forest is not blindly casting a net. On the contrary, its purpose is very clear. From the beginning, the target customers of Yuanqi forest are white-collar workers and generation Z young people. Therefore, it will try its best in marketing.<br>For example, under the pressure of fast-paced life, young people prefer to watch variety shows online. Variety shows and online dramas have become the first goal of Yuanqi forest sponsorship. Variety shows such as “a string of life” and “a vigorous brother” are based on this logic. On the choice of spokesperson, the yuan forest also favored the new generation and national high stars, such as Chen Feiyu, Yiyang Qianxi, Gu Ailing and so on.<br>At the beginning of 2021, Yuanqi forest won the sponsorship right of station B Spring Festival Gala with 150 million yuan, realizing the leap of station B fans from 0 to 1.5 million. Although Yuanqi forest has been criticized by the outside world for its large marketing investment, it can be said that almost every penny of its investment has been shown to consumers.<br>By the end of 2020, the sales of Yuanqi forest reached 2.7 billion yuan. The sales growth rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 300%, 200% and 309% respectively, which was very amazing.<br>However, in 2022, the “gambling luck” of Yuanqi forest may not be so good.</p>

It is said that there will be “no more” vitality forest in the market in 2022.<br>Whether the news is true or false, a more obvious phenomenon is that in recent years, Yuanqi forest has put pressure on many established beverage enterprises in the market.<br>The concept of “0 sugar, 0 fat, 0 calorie” health drink created by Yuanqi forest has rapidly become a trend in the context of new consumption. In its explosive growth in 2020, many established beverage enterprises such as Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, nongnongshan spring and Wahaha also tried to launch the same type of bubble water, but with little effect. In this track developed by Yuanqi forest, Yuanqi forest seems to have the absolute initiative.<br>Beverage giants are obviously unwilling to see this situation. Therefore, in 2021, many OEM factories of Yuanqi forest had to choose to shut down under pressure, which once caused Yuanqi forest to encounter a capacity crisis. Nowadays, Yuanqi forest has made greater efforts to invest in self built factories, and the lack of production capacity has played a great role in promoting it.<br>It is undeniable that since the vitality forest temporarily emerged, the beverage giants have implemented almost all-round encirclement and interception, and the latter has been struggling to survive. Obviously, in 2022, the pressure from the giants will rise to a higher level. Can the vitality forest resist it?<br>At the end of last year, Yuanqi forest disclosed some business data for the first time: as of September, the company’s R &amp; D cost had increased by 350% year-on-year. In the past 12 months, more than 30 kinds of beverage flavors have been added, and the average product R &amp; D cycle is 5.5 months.<br>It can be seen that Yuanqi forest has not stopped its R &amp; D. on the contrary, its R &amp; D investment is still increasing year by year. Besides upgrading in taste and other aspects, product lines are also extending. Now, it involves many kinds of bubbles, such as bubble water, milk tea, tea drink, functional beverage, coffee, light food Baijiu and liquor.<br>Rich SKUs make Yuanqi forest more likely to resist risks. However, it is worth noting that bubble water is still the main source of sales revenue of Yuanqi forest. If the weight of other products cannot be improved, it will be one of the hidden dangers of Yuanqi forest.<br>In addition to paying attention to the product itself, in terms of market expansion, Yuanqi forest also made a plan to go to sea early. At the end of 2021, Yuanqi forest said that in mid December, its overseas aluminum can bubble water broke into the top 10 of Amazon bubble water best seller list in the United States. At present, the products of Yuanqi forest have landed in more than 40 countries and regions, and the sea strategy has achieved initial results.<br>As a young emerging brand, Yuanqi forest does have many shortcomings, and its enterprise heritage can not compete with beverage giants. However, the emergence of vitality forest has exploded a thunder in the almost solidified bottled beverage market, just like a catfish reactivating the market.<br>The beverage industry needs fresh blood, which is the law of market development. Even if there is no “vitality forest”, other new consumer brands will launch an impact. The “encirclement, pursuit and interception” of the vitality forest by beverage giants is not only the maintenance of their own interests, but also the embodiment of their failure to timely understand the potential development trend of the market.<br>Although it is certain that the life of Yuanqi forest will not be so “easy” in 2022, the pressure from giants is difficult to hurt the root, and Yuanqi forest still has room for growth.<br>This article is from WeChat official account “Xiao Qian note” (ID:xiaoqianshuo), 36 krypton authorized release.</p>
