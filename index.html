          <p>On February 7, the famous leisure snack brand Yanjin shop announced that based on the recognition of the company’s long-term value and confidence in the company’s future development, the shares held by Hunan Yanjin shop Holding Co., Ltd. will be extended for another two years.<br>It is worth noting that previously, on January 19, Yanjin shop announced the termination of the shareholding increase plan. The actual controllers, some directors and senior executives of Yanjin shop originally planned to increase their holdings by no less than 50 million yuan, but actually increased their holdings by only 12.5487 million yuan, which actually completed only 25.1% of the original shareholding increase plan.<br>Executives directly broke the deal to increase their holdings, causing extreme dissatisfaction among shareholders. As of February 14, 2022, the share price of Yanjin shop has fallen by 24% this year, and the share price has halved from the highest point in 2020.<br>From the soaring stock prices in 2019 and 2020 to the falling stock prices today; From the increase plan to “empty check” to extending the lock-in period, a series of operations of Yanjin shop reflect the process of enterprises from development and growth, to weak growth, and then to innovation and change.<br>Yanjin shop is not the only one facing the bottleneck of development. The three squirrels, a snack giant that started with internet marketing, not only went on a hot search due to the non-compliance and controversial advertising pictures, but also suffered a reduction in holdings by major shareholders.<br>Why can’t the Internet traffic of leisure snacks run? What common problems does the industry face? How will enterprises see and break down their moves?</p>
<h3 id="Drifting-dividends"><a href="#Drifting-dividends" class="headerlink" title="Drifting dividends"></a>Drifting dividends</h3><p>In the golden decade of the Internet, many industries have hitchhiked the rapid development of e-commerce and also achieved rapid expansion of scale. As a member of traditional retail, snack food can be said to be the leader in the “east wind”.<br>According to the compound growth rate of CNR securities in 2013 ~ 2020, the sales scale of leisure food reached 9%; The compound annual growth rate of online sales scale exceeds 45%. The increasing popularity of online shopping and the rise of e-commerce promote the rapid development of online channels of leisure food.<br>However, there are also several joys and sorrows in the snack food camp.<br>Since the beginning of Yifen, for example, the former leaders have lost their team in the wave of e-commerce. According to laiyifen’s financial report for the first half of 2021, online e-commerce channels account for only 12.9% of its total revenue.<br>In sharp contrast, three squirrels and liangpin store accounted for 70% and 52% of online revenue respectively.<br>Although Baicao flavor first opened offline stores, its sales increased significantly after its transformation to online stores in 2010, with an annual sales growth of more than 4 billion yuan and a sharp increase in revenue of more than 100 times.<br>In fact, as early as 2011, laiyifen began to layout online channels, but the result was “getting up early and catching up late”. Due to over reliance on its own applications, Laifen did not invest too much resources in the third-party platform, which naturally missed the dividend period of e-commerce.<br>With the penetration of the Internet approaching its peak in China, the curtain of the golden decade of e-commerce is slowly falling, and the future development will change from the previous high-speed growth period to a stable maturity period.<br>From the tiktok of Taobao to the present situation of Taobao, Jingdong, spelling and meet as equals, the trend of Internet centralization is inevitable. Similarly, snack brands will also adapt to the new pattern in the era of traffic decentralization.<br>In short, the good days are over, and the bad days are still ahead.<br>Tiktok Kwai, who has ploughed Taobao and Jingdong, has launched three groups of squirrels, including the rapid distribution of the fast track, the sound of live broadcasting, the group purchase, the selection of the group, the purchase of vegetables, the optimization of orange hearts, and so on.<br>According to the three first year of the squirrel’s earnings report, the number of new business operators, such as jitter, and so on, the total revenue of the new business is nearly 10%. The total revenue of the new business is tiktok, which is nearly 10%. At the same time, its promotion fee and platform service fee increased by nearly 51% year-on-year, but the drainage effect is much worse than before.<br>The company said that online platform traffic was further dispersed, and multiple traffic entrances led to a decline in the traffic of mainstream e-commerce channels and a slowdown in the growth of online sales.<br>In the future, whether online or offline, it is unrealistic to travel around the world on one leg. The new retail mode of online and offline integration will be the future development direction of the snack industry.<br>At the autumn sugar and Wine Fair in Tianjin in 2021, three squirrels announced that they would focus on offline distribution channels and plan to achieve a revenue target of 10 billion yuan in five years.<br>Zhang Liaoyuan, CEO of three squirrels, once said that the online efficiency of brands is the highest from 0 to 1, because what you see is what you get; However, the probability of people’s life radius is still offline. If you want to make the brand from 1 to 10, you still get offline.<br>Since 2020, three squirrels starting from second and third tier cities have begun to layout the third to fifth tier sinking market.</p>
<h3 id="Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war"><a href="#Health-food-encirclement-and-suppression-war" class="headerlink" title="Health food encirclement and suppression war"></a>Health food encirclement and suppression war</h3><p>In the era of material scarcity, snacks give people the meaning of “delicious”. The satisfaction of taste buds has become the only standard to define whether a snack brand is qualified or even excellent.<br>Who ever thought that one day, “too delicious” will eat back the brand itself?<br>“Too delicious” often means sweet and salty. In other words, there are too many seasonings and additives in food.<br>When people’s material life is rapidly enriched, consumers’ demands have also jumped from simple “delicious”. As an important part of determining health, diet began to develop in a healthier direction.<br>Delicious food is no longer the highest goal pursued by diners, and even most people are willing to give up the enjoyment between lips and teeth for health. As a result, sugar free, less salt, non fried, vegetable meat, these words stand on the capital highland with healthy food.<br>The change of consumer concept indicates the subversion of industrial logic. Members in the industry are powerless to change. Just like the original Internet trend, if they can’t ride the wind and waves, they can only be submerged in huge waves.<br>In order to get rid of consumers’ inherent impression that traditional snacks are “not very healthy”, snack brand giants have played a “health card”.<br>For example, liangpin shop has launched a high calcium bar of bovine colostrum. 90% of the raw materials are whole milk powder, and the other 10% are bovine colostrum, natural sugar substitutes, dietary fiber, etc. it is a real healthy food; In 2021, Jiajia food will clearly focus on resources and build “salt reduction” into a large single product at the strategic level; One of the new product R &amp; D ideas of Shuanghui development is to develop low-fat, low sodium and other new products around functional health food.<br>However, it is not easy for the traditional snacks of “halfway monk” to seize the healthy track?<br>First of all, the first mover advantage of healthy food has basically been occupied by major healthy food bosses.<br>The products and marketing strategies of these brands are more targeted, and have established strong reputation advantages and fan resources. It is not easy for new brands to attack the city and pull out the stronghold.<br>Secondly, how to balance the development of traditional snacks and healthy snacks is a difficult problem.<br>For example, consumers have deep-rooted impressions of traditional snacks, and it may take a long time to do a good job of ideological guidance for consumers. It is the best choice to be able to fly with both wings, but whether it will take care of one thing and lose the other, or even not fall at both ends, requires careful consideration by the enterprise.<br>The road to health is not easy.</p>
<h3 id="Broken-arm-survival-unknown"><a href="#Broken-arm-survival-unknown" class="headerlink" title="Broken arm survival unknown"></a>Broken arm survival unknown</h3><p>As an industry with low threshold, the competition of leisure snack industry is like a wolf. It’s no exaggeration to say “ten snack brands and nine nuts”.<br>In order to avoid homogeneous competition and forced to fight a price war, high-end seems to be the only way for head players.<br>According to the data of China National Business Information Center, the year-on-year growth rate of all channels in the high-end snack market in 2020 was more than 10%, far exceeding the growth rate of 6% in the overall snack market.<br>Although the development of snack categories is relatively simple, too many single items will still cause a heavy burden on the supply chain. A large number of SKUs will bring more capital risks to the brand and dilute the brand assets, resulting in problems such as increased costs and decreased gross profit margin.<br>In addition, the OEM model used by many snack brands is more likely to increase doubts about food safety and quality in front of hundreds of SKUs.<br>If we want to focus on the development of high-end lines, it means the integration of existing product lines.<br>In October 2020, three squirrels decided to cut down 300 SKUs, which is equivalent to half of the SKUs at that time. The three squirrels started the slimming plan mainly because the sales volume of these SKUs did not meet expectations and the input-output ratio was not high.<br>In the future, the three squirrels plan to transform from a full category brand to a brand of “nuts and dried fruits + selected food”.<br>Coincidentally, the high-end evolution of Yanjin shop is also in progress.<br>Different from the OEM mode of liangpin shop, three squirrels and other head leisure snack brands, Yanjin shop controls the whole chain of R &amp; D, production and sales. Founder Zhang Xuewu once told the outside world that he wanted to create a “Huawei in the snack industry” through his own unique model.<br>In 2021, Yanjin shop will also shrink its categories, including new products such as coke fish tofu, COD tofu, crab fillet and fish intestines. At the same time, it is planned to make baking, deep-sea food, spicy brine and dried fruit the forefront of the industry in the next 2-3 years.<br>Of course, the high-end road is not easy to go.<br>In recent years, although it still holds the top position of leisure snacks, the gross profit margin of the three squirrels has declined year by year, even worse than the average level of the industry. With the trend of diversified snacks gradually emerging, it may be difficult for the three squirrels to return to their peak market share.<br>In order to achieve high-end achievements, the R &amp; D expenses of liangpin store increased from 24.38 million yuan in 2019 to 33.71 million yuan in 2020, a year-on-year increase of 38%, and continued to increase year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2021.<br>From the perspective of product lines, liangpin store launched the children’s snack brand “liangpin snack Fairy” and the healthy substitute food brand “liangpin Feiyang” respectively in 2020. However, in the first half of 2021, the sales of xiaoshixian accounted for only 4% of the total revenue, and Feiyang accounted for only 2%.<br>It can be seen that leisure snack brands are still in the sowing stage of high-end upgrading war. You can only get if you can give up, but whether you can really get something after you give up remains to be verified by time.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue" class="headerlink" title="epilogue"></a>epilogue</h3><p>Although there are three leading enterprises such as squirrels and liangpin shop, the pattern of China’s leisure food industry is still very scattered. In terms of retail sales, the proportion of Cr5 in the industry in 2020 is only 10%.<br>As emerging brands such as Wang Yanfu and Shizu are favored by capital, the new forces are coming in one after another, and the white hot internal war in the industry is still intensifying.<br>Due to the low threshold and high degree of homogenization, “being imitated all the time” is an inevitable law in the snack industry. Whether it can “never be surpassed” will be the most important issue for each brand.<br>Whether it is healthy, high-end, or the decentralization of the Internet, we have to go. In the historical process of industry change, only by accelerating the pace and walking in the forefront can we have a greater chance of winning. As a foodie, we just need to taste delicious food and watch the surging of snacks in the Jianghu.<br>The picture comes from the Japanese drama “weight loss rebound”<br>Come on, what snacks do you usually like to eat?<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat’s new retail business review (ID:xinlingshou1001). The author is koala, a deer, authorized by 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>Health care, semiconductors and new energy, which are hot investment tracks in 2021, not only continue to reach new financing highs in the primary market, but also perform well in the secondary market.<br>After reviewing all the public data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2021, I found that the science and innovation board is gradually forming a cluster effect on the relevant tracks, and has given good returns. According to my incomplete statistics, a total of 162 enterprises landed on the science and innovation board in 2021, distributed in many fields such as medicine and health, semiconductor, information technology, production and manufacturing.<br>Tian Xuan, vice president of Wudaokou School of finance of Tsinghua University, also said that there are more emerging high-tech enterprises in the above fields, which also reflects the transformation of China’s capital market from traditional cyclical enterprises to high-tech, high-tech and hard core technology enterprises.<br>Taking the medical track as an example, 38 pharmaceutical and biological companies were listed on the science and innovation board in 2021, which is much higher than 28 in 2020 and 14 in 2019. Among the 38 enterprises, there are not only star innovative pharmaceutical enterprises such as Baiji Shenzhou, industry leaders such as Weigao orthopedics, but also many subdivided fields such as chemical agents, in vitro diagnosis, medical equipment and vaccines.<br>Hubble investment has also reaped five IPOs. The ones listed on the science and innovation board in 2021 are canqin technology, Dongxin shares and Juguang technology. In addition, it also includes sirip, which was listed in September 2020, and Tianyue advanced, which was listed in January 2022. The book returns brought by these five IPO projects have reached more than 6 billion yuan, more than twice the total size of the fund.<br>At the capital level, the 162 companies listed on the science and innovation board raised up to 202.9 billion yuan, higher than the gem and the main board, of which the gem was about 147.5 billion yuan and the main board was about 184.7 billion yuan. The scientific innovation board is playing its unique charm.</p>
<h3 id="Pharmaceutical-companies-flocked-to-the-scientific-innovation-board"><a href="#Pharmaceutical-companies-flocked-to-the-scientific-innovation-board" class="headerlink" title="Pharmaceutical companies flocked to the scientific innovation board"></a>Pharmaceutical companies flocked to the scientific innovation board</h3><p>In the context of the epidemic, the medical and health industry is hot all over the world. According to the statistics of data company innovative, excluding the SPAC part, the total number of global IPOs in 2021 is 2097, and the proportion of the medical and health industry is about 15.8%, second only to technology.<br>The same is true of the performance of the science and innovation board. In 2021, 38 pharmaceutical and biological companies were listed on the science and innovation board, which is much higher than 28 in 2020 and 14 in 2019. Among the 38 enterprises, there are not only star innovative pharmaceutical enterprises such as Baiji Shenzhou, industry leaders such as Weigao orthopedics, but also many subdivided fields such as chemical agents, in vitro diagnosis, medical equipment and vaccines.<br>In these segments, innovative drugs and medical devices perform well. Among them, Baiji Shenzhou is one of the leading companies in China’s innovative pharmaceutical enterprises, and is the world’s first three listed A+H+N company. Its main business is research, development, production and commercialization of innovative drugs, raising about 22 billion 200 million yuan, more than second and Optoelectronics combined with third times.<br>Of course, at present, the share price of Baiji Shenzhou also remained depressed after the first day of listing. As of February 21, 2022, a total of 182 companies on the science and innovation board have announced the performance forecast for 2021. Among them, three of the top five listed companies with the largest losses are in the pharmaceutical industry, and Baiji China bears the brunt.<br>Some analysts said that this is related to its high R &amp; D expenses, and when to make a profit has become the first problem in front of Baiji. Nevertheless, experts commented that Baiji Shenzhou has created many industry precedents. Among many biotech companies, Baiji Shenzhou is still one of the most likely to be upgraded to big pharma.<br>When it comes to Baiji Shenzhou, we have to mention the layout of strategic capital in innovative medicine. Hillhouse capital has accompanied Baiji Shenzhou for nearly eight years. It has not only participated in round a and round B financing, but also in the strategic financing after listing. It is the only leading investment investor of Baiji Shenzhou in China, covering the whole life cycle.<br>In addition to Baiji Shenzhou, Gaoling also invested in three innovative drug enterprises in a row, namely Hengrui, Xinda and Junshi biology. Hillhouse capital’s shareholding in these PD1 companies increased from 0.6% to nearly 10%. It not only invested a lot, but also invested in the top four of the track.<br>Li Xiaoyan, a well-known institutional investor, told me that in the A-share market, the listing of a large number of innovative pharmaceutical enterprises is no longer scarce, and capital is also paying continuous attention. At the same time, the licensing and cooperation of innovative pharmaceutical projects between China and countries around the world are becoming increasingly active. “However, China’s basic research is still weak, the homogenization of drug research and development is serious, and a large number of them are still in the clinical stage.”<br>However, with the good performance of the secondary market, the pace of innovative drug research and development is bound to accelerate, which will also shorten his whole life cycle. Investors who hit many medical and health enterprises also include Yida investment, Qiming venture capital, Junlian capital and Lilly Asia Fund.<br>Song Qinghui, an economist, also said in an interview that as an R &amp; D driven industry, the pharmaceutical and biological industry is in line with the positioning attribute of the science and innovation board. Compared with traditional pharmaceutical enterprises, innovative pharmaceutical enterprises will be recognized by the market in the future, and the price valuation will be higher and higher.</p>

In other words, the cluster effect of Kechuang board on semiconductor enterprises has appeared. According to incomplete statistics, in 2021, a total of 20 enterprises registered on the science and innovation board, and many enterprises started listing counseling.<br>Behind these semiconductor enterprises, one investor silently harvested three IPOs in a year, which is Huawei’s Hubble investment. In 2019, Huawei broke the principle of “not investing in suppliers” and registered its subsidiary Hubble investment to make large-scale investment in the semiconductor industry chain. After several capital increases, Hubble investment has a registered capital of 3 billion yuan.<br>According to my incomplete statistics, Hubble investment has now reaped five IPOs. Those listed on the science and innovation board in 2021 are canqin technology, Dongxin shares and Juguang technology. In addition, it also includes sirip, which was listed in September 2020, and Tianyue advanced, which was listed in January 2022. The book returns brought by these five IPO projects have reached more than 6 billion yuan, more than twice the total size of the fund.<br>Canqin technology, which was listed in November 2021, is an important supplier in the upstream of the global 5g industrial chain. It is used for the reception, transmission and processing of RF signals. It is widely used in the fields of mobile communication, radar and RF circuits, micro communication navigation and positioning. The company’s largest customer h and its enterprises under the same control contributed 91% of the revenue. It is speculated that Huawei is the company. Hubble’s investment in canqin technology was 110 million yuan, with a return of 2.8 times.<br>The Dongxin shares listed in December were invested by Hubble in May 2020, and now the shareholding ratio is about 4%. Dongxin semiconductor is a memory chip design company. Its products are used in 5g communication, Internet of things terminals, consumer electronics, automotive electronics and other fields. With the same torch technology listed in December, Hubble took shares in the pre-C round in 2019. Its main products are high-power semiconductor Aurora components and Aurora components upstream of the laser industry.<br>It is reported that the investment return multiples of Dongxin shares and Juguang technology are more than 8 times.<br>In addition to Hubble, the institutions that hit relevant enterprises in the semiconductor field include SMIC Juyuan, Walden International, etc. SMIC Juyuan is the joint management team of SMIC international, which was established in 2014. Walden International has also been along the industrial layout of semiconductors and is a professional investment institution focusing on the industry.</p>

There are more than 30 investors standing behind it, including Xiaomi Changjiang industry fund, Shenzhen Venture Capital, Lenovo venture capital, GAC capital, Guoke investment, etc. This is a supplier of consumer polymer soft packed lithium-ion batteries. In the field of power batteries, it has also entered the supply chain system of many well-known automobile enterprises.<br>Other energy track enterprises also include xinfengguang, boliwei, xiatungsten Xinneng, Changchang lithium, etc. It can be seen that the new energy industry chain will have the opportunity to “become a member” in subdivided fields, including photovoltaic, energy storage, lithium battery, hydrogen energy and terminal applications.<br>Some investors believe that the whole new energy track investment is in a business cycle, and there are various types of capital in the upstream, middle and downstream.<br>Zhu Jia, partner of Lightspeed China, mentioned in an interview, “Taking the lithium battery industry chain as an example, the upstream materials of lithium battery, including its positive electrode, negative electrode, diaphragm and electrolyte, involve a lot of technological innovation, and the ultimate goal of innovation is to continuously improve the energy density of lithium battery, improve safety and prolong the number of cycles, so this is a field with very intensive technology.”<br>According to the data of BP world energy statistical yearbook, China has the highest carbon emission in the world by 2019; From 2015 to 2019, China’s carbon emissions grew at an average annual rate of 1.2%, exceeding the global level of 0.8%. China needs to make more efforts than developed countries such as Europe and the United States to achieve carbon peak in less than 9 years and carbon neutralization in the next 30 years.<br>At the same time, China’s new energy investment has seen its first climax since 2016-2017 and its second climax in the past two years. There is an important reason for this. The development of new energy is gradually getting rid of the previous government’s consistent subsidy model. Today, the market is gradually accepting the development of new energy industry, reducing costs and increasing consumption willingness, The whole industry has entered a positive cycle.</p>

IPO continued to grow by 13% on the basis of the fund-raising peak of 480 billion yuan in 2020.<br>Among the 524 IPO companies in 2021, there were 199 IPO companies on the gem, 162 IPO companies on the science and innovation board, 122 IPO companies on the main board and 41 IPO companies on the Beijing stock exchange. The number of IPO companies in the two innovation sectors accounted for 69% of the total.<br>Among the investors behind 162 enterprises, Shenzhen Venture Capital ranked first with 10 hits, involving intelligent manufacturing, new generation information technology, energy, medicine and other industries. In addition to Shenzhen Venture Capital, Yida capital, Tongchuang Weiye and Honghui fund also performed well.<br>Five of the ten enterprises - Jiulian technology, yahuilong, Qipai technology, Yingke environmental protection and Huayi technology all entered in the early a-round or angel round.<br>Taking Anlu technology as an example, Shenzhen Venture Capital once said in summarizing the logic of investing in Anlu technology that “what the country needs, what Shenzhen Venture capital invests”. In 2019, Shenzhen Venture Capital conducted a detailed industry research around the “made in China 2025” strategy and found that there was a phenomenon of explicit graphics card neck in FPGA chips in China’s chip segmentation field. At that time, foreign enterprises occupied about 90% of the domestic market. In the process of combing the industry, Anlu technology was seen and invested by Shenzhen Venture Capital.<br>Born in Jiangsu high tech investment group, Yida capital is one of the earliest provincial equity and venture capital institutions in China. At present, there are 115.5 billion projects invested by Yida, with a total capital of more than 100 billion. Founded in June 2000, Tongchuang Weiye is the first batch of professional private equity investment companies in China, with assets of more than 20 billion yuan and more than 400 enterprises. Honghui fund was founded in July 2014 by Wang Hui, the former investment partner of CDH investment and a member of the investment committee.<br>Zheng Weihe, chairman of Tongchuang Weiye, also said when referring to the investment theme of 2022, “in the capital market, the head institutions of the primary market accelerate the development, especially the head institutions of RMB; foreign capital GP is RMB; it is a trend to invest early and small, invest in hard technology and invest in biomedicine; the premium effect of popular industries in the secondary market brings greater arbitrage space to the primary market.”<br>What cannot be ignored is that according to the data of Oriental choice, there are 17 listed companies known as the “meat grinder” of the science and innovation board, whose share prices broke on the first day of listing, and the share prices have continued to fall so far.<br>Perhaps, this year’s sci-tech innovation board can give a clearer indication of investment.<br>For more details, please refer to the following table:<br>This article is from WeChat official account ID:China-Venture, the author: Li Tongwei, 36 krypton authorized.</p>

          <p>A dream.<br>On February 21, the day after the Winter Olympics, Migu video fell to No. 52 in the free app list (iPhone end) of Diandian data platform.<br>This is still the result of the short rise after the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics. On the day before the closing ceremony, Migu video has fallen to No. 88, and the ranking tends to return to about 200 before the Winter Olympics.<br>Before that, Migu video had just spent two weeks of “suddenly like the spring breeze of one night”.<br>On the first day of spring and the opening day of the Winter Olympics, the dau (number of daily active users) of Migu video increased by 2.7 million. In the subsequent schedule, its dau remained at about 11 million, almost double that before the Winter Olympics. From February 5 to 9, in the general list of Diandian data free app (iPhone), Migu video jumped from the top 200 to the second, followed by the central video.<br>The reason for topping the list is simple: Migu video and central video are the only platform for “two” users to watch the whole live broadcast of the event on the mobile terminal. Compared with the central video, Migu video also has one more hand - Wang Meng, a former Olympic champion and now a Winter Olympic commentator with “eyes like a ruler”.<br>However, as the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, the number of users of Migu video began to decline. On February 9 and 11, its daily life fell by 11.26% and 11.24% respectively… Until it returned to the situation before the Winter Olympics before and after the closing ceremony.<br>This scene also appeared at the 2018 World Cup. In 2022, after the warm wind at the beginning of spring, will Migu video go out of the cycle of ending the season and maintaining the same traffic?</p>
<h3 id="01-Migu-video-performance-competition"><a href="#01-Migu-video-performance-competition" class="headerlink" title="01 Migu video performance competition"></a>01 Migu video performance competition</h3><p>In the broadcast “field” of this winter Olympic Games, Migu video has almost no opponent like existence.<br>Migu video is one of the few “players” who can stand on the field according to whether they have the broadcasting right or not.<br>The central television broadcasting station said in the statement of copyright protection of Winter Olympic Games: the video platform that won the broadcasting rights of this winter Olympic Games is only three Kwai goo videos, Tencent and fast hands. Further observation will show that Tencent and Kwai have only the right to live broadcast live, that is to say, if you want to watch the live broadcast of the whole event, the mobile terminal users have only two choices: Central video (CCTV) and Mi Gu video.<br>Facts have proved that the two platforms did have bright data after the Winter Olympics. Baidu Index shows that since February 4, the search indexes of both have increased significantly and remained at a high level for several days. During this period, the search index of “aiyouteng” three platforms was flat or decreased. Little data shows that the estimated downloads of Migu video increased by 13.5 times month on month in the first week of the Winter Olympics.<br>In the second step of seizing the leading position, Migu video relies on explaining this card. During the Winter Olympics, former Olympic champion Wang Meng, who served as Migu video commentary, repeatedly boarded the microblog hot search and contributed golden sentences such as “my eyes are feet”. On the day after Wang Meng finished his last interpretation of the Winter Olympics, as of February 17, the total number of topics read by microblog # Wang Meng interpretation # reached 2.67 billion, exceeding 2.57 billion of Gu Ailing’s gold medal.<br>Wang Meng’s out of the circle has also further driven the data growth of Migu video. Many users said in the comment area that “because of Wang Meng, Download Migu video and recharge members”. Coincidentally, the two significant increases of Migu video Baidu Index also appeared on the day after Wang Mengyin explained the circle, one of which was “my eyes are feet”, and the other came from a clear and clear explanation of the reasons for the foul committed by Hungarian players in men’s short track 1000m speed skating.<br>The share price of China Mobile, the gold owner behind Migu video, was also boosted. On the day Gu ailing won the gold medal on February 8, the A-share price of China Mobile once rose by more than 6%, and the first week of the Winter Olympic Games rose by 15.68%.</p>
<h3 id="“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast"><a href="#“Survivor”-of-02-event-broadcast" class="headerlink" title="“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast"></a>“Survivor” of 02 event broadcast</h3><p>The sports broadcasting business that Migu video has bet heavily is actually a hard bone that many platforms can’t attack for a long time.<br>LETV sports, Suning sports, Tencent video and Sports Olympic power were all important players on the card table. In October 2014, when the broadcasting rights of sports events were liberalized, the momentum of the Olympic Games was 8 billion for the 5 years, the most colorful footnote in the market bubble.<br>However, the high copyright fees and slow and rare returns of sports events have also become a heavy burden on video platforms. Sun Hongbin, an investor of LETV sports and founder of rongchuang, once said at the 2016 performance conference that “LETV spent 1.35 billion last year (2016) and only received 50 million in total.”<br>Finally, the platforms with heavy positions in sports broadcasting rights may be dragged down, or choose to shrink the cost and protect themselves.<br>Migu video has been able to carry it up to now, due to its ingenious admission time, the financial and technical support of China Mobile behind it, and a lighter operation mode.<br>In 2018, when the video came into the market, the market bubble of sports copyright had gradually dissipated, and copyright prices had dropped sharply. Wei Jianglei, former senior vice president of sina.com, said in an interview with the media at the end of 2017: “on the whole, the copyright price is much lower than the high point, and the gap is three to five times.”<br>If the good admission time makes Migu video account for “Tianshi”, the support of the parent company China Mobile has created a “favorable location”.<br>From the perspective of financial strength, Migu video, backed by China Mobile, has obvious financial advantages compared with other platforms, which has also become the foundation for it to buy a large number of sports copyrights.<br>Supporting Migu video’s entry into sports broadcasting is also in line with China Mobile’s own development interests. In its music, video, reading and other businesses, sports event broadcasting is obviously the best way to give full play to its 5g network advantages.<br>In addition to the support of the sponsor, Migu video also makes careful calculations on the cost side - different from the self built studio and self broadcasting of sports live broadcasting platforms such as Tencent live broadcasting and PP live broadcasting, the outsourcing of broadcasting work is Migu’s “magic weapon” for saving money.<br>Southern Weekend quoted a number of insiders as saying that after purchasing the copyright, Migu did not broadcast directly by itself, but outsourced the broadcasting work to a third-party company. The latter adds the live room signal, loads the subtitles, and then pushes it to Migu platform. In other words, Migu video only provides a viewing platform. This method effectively saves costs, such as the cost of expensive studio, live broadcasting equipment, specially assigned personnel to maintain equipment, as well as the vacancy cost during the off-season.<br>Different from the careful calculation of broadcasting, Migu video has been laid out in the field of interpretation for a long time, and has always been a great deal of investment in the interpretation team. This is also the background of the “Wang Meng phenomenon” in this winter Olympic Games.<br>Last year’s Tokyo Olympic Games, Migu video invited more than 100 hosts and guests, including 30 well-known sports commentators, 12 Olympic champions and 20 world champions. The interpretation team of the Winter Olympics is even better, with more than 150 commentators and guests.<br>In addition, in the selection of commentators, Migu video has formed its own playing method - try to choose popular guests who are easy to break the circle or bring their own traffic to explain. Wang Meng, who made frequent golden sentences, Chen Chen, the track and field commentator known as the “human computer” at the Tokyo Olympic Games, and Lu Han in the European Cup final.<br>Having tasted the dividends brought by the “interpretation circle” for many times, Migu video prepared the live broadcast team of this winter Olympic Games early. Wang Meng was one of the first guests invited by Migu video. In January this year, Migu video went online to select the variety “boiling! Commentator” for sports commentary, so as to reserve strength for its commentary team. Wang Meng participated in it at that time.<br>Relying on the deep interpretation team, Migu video further strengthens the interaction between users and the platform. In the Winter Olympics, Migu provided a variety of interpretation combinations for users to choose from, and even specially set up Cantonese interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="03-a-game-a-dream"><a href="#03-a-game-a-dream" class="headerlink" title="03 a game, a dream?"></a>03 a game, a dream?</h3><p>But the story of users leaving the game after the game is repeated.<br>With the Winter Olympics coming to an end, the download volume of Migu video has continued to decline, even lower than the average value in recent months from February 12 to February 19. It seems that with the end of Wang Meng’s interpretation, the Winter Olympics is coming to an end, and users are gradually “leaving” from Migu.<br>This is reminiscent of the ups and downs of its past events. According to the annual report of China Mobile, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, 4.3 billion people watched the game through Migu video client. However, the monthly active number fell by 11.35% in the four months after the event. In the month following the end of the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, the monthly activity of Migu video fell by 32.28%.<br>The situation of heavy gold and water is also happening in Kwai Fu. Kwai tiktok is the only platform to get the right to broadcast and return the Winter Olympic Games in the short video platform. However, in a number of media reports, Kwai 2 billion 500 million has been betting on the two Olympic Games (Tokyo Olympic Games and Beijing Winter Olympic Games).<br>The strategy adopted by Kwai in this winter Olympic Games is to upload and replay, and update the old ways of medal list and schedule in time. But tiktok, which is the short video platform, has been overtaking by tiktok, relying on the introduction of sports stars. Especially the early popularity of Gu Ailing and Su Yi Ming has greatly boosted the activity of the jitter during the Winter Olympics. During the Winter Olympics, the downloads of the Kwai Po were even lower than January’s average downloads.<br>Just like the fast hand picked the wrong operation strategy, there is obviously a shortage of the long video strategy of the microkwai video.<br>At present, Migu, standing on the video platform track, chooses the strategy of focusing on sports and supplemented by film and television dramas. But the question is, during the off-season, what does Migu video take to retain users?<br>At present, Migu video platform is like a collection of major video platforms, presenting content from Mango TV, iqiyi, Tencent video, etc. This may be related to its strategy of purchasing copyright from other platforms. In November 2021, Migu video also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with mango hypermedia with a cooperation amount of no less than 3.5 billion yuan within three years.<br>However, from the playback volume data, users are still more inclined to chase dramas on the original video platform.<br>Obviously, non exclusive content can make up for the shortcomings of Migu video in the content pool, but it can not distinguish Migu video from other video platforms. As a result, Migu video is like the user’s “monthly throwing” app, which is “abandoned” by the user immediately after the end of the competition for one to two months.<br>From the perspective of event broadcasting rights, Migu has few hands, including the broadcasting rights of Qatar world cup from November to December 2022 and China Asian Cup from June to July 2023.<br>For Migu, sports copyright has proved to be an excellent breakthrough direction, but it is not a bottomless moat. After all, it is the event itself rather than the platform that attracts the audience.<br>Relying on the rich and powerful gold owner, it is true that he can get a good hand of cards, but after the cards are played, for Migu video, which is absent in the field of entertainment, variety, film and television and other original content, how to retain the influx of users during the season is a beautiful problem that needs to be considered most.<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:xuebaocaijingshe, and is published by Gao Xuyang, 36 krypton.</p>

          <p>E-commerce platforms and logistics companies have been “in love and killing each other” for a long time.<br>The rise of e-commerce has promoted the rapid development of the express market towards maturity, and the industry has gradually cleared up. Small express enterprises have exited one after another. In this process, the reconstruction of the supply chain by e-commerce mode has reduced the cost of logistics in commodity sales and further suppressed the profitability of express.<br>However, logistics is also the lifeblood of e-commerce. The reason is that e-commerce must eventually fall to the stage of competitive services. The timeliness of distribution and terminal distribution capacity related to terminal services determine that logistics has become an important link connecting consumers.<br>The above “competition and cooperation” relationship has been highlighted in the development of e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, jd.com and pinduoduo.<br>Tiktok is a situation of tripartite confrontation between overweeningly ambitious businesses and the need for logistics.<br>Recently, the voice of the tiktok has been distributing frequently. It is said that according to a person close to byte beat, byte has completed its investment in polar rabbit express to supplement the e-commerce puzzle and expand the layout of overseas e-commerce.<br>It is self-evident that the message is not true, but the position of bytes to make up logistics services is self-evident. Tiktok said.<br>In addition, in January 12th, according to media reports, the voice tiktok opened the test express service “Yin Zun Da”, providing door-to-door service. It is reported that the service has been experienced by some merchants.<br>From these actions, the pace of building e-commerce closed loop is accelerating.<br>For e-commerce platforms, there are two ways to supplement logistics services:<br>First, build a self built logistics platform, and then replace the original third-party services; Second, it is highly integrated with the information system of logistics partners to improve operation efficiency and reduce operation costs.<br>In China, JD chose the self operated mode, while Alibaba chose the integrated mode.<br>Since rookie is the only way to build a closed loop for e-commerce, there are also rookies and Jingdong pearl Yu before. Then, which way will tiktok e-commerce choose? Or is it a self reliant Mountain Gate?</p>
<h3 id="01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease"><a href="#01-tiktok’s-logistics-heart-disease" class="headerlink" title="01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease"></a>01 tiktok’s logistics heart disease</h3><p>Last August 1st, Zhang bought a garment on the tiktok platform, and the company promised to deliver the goods within 7-10. But wait until the 10 showed the delivery information. He could not wait to check the order again. He found the order showed that “your parcel is being blocked because it is being blocked.”<br>At that time, Zhang felt quite strange. On the premise that he did not receive any express, and in the previous communication with the express company, he did not mention rejecting the express, so the package was returned for no reason.<br>Zhang hang then dialed the manual customer service number of the express company that delivered the goods. The customer service showed that the merchant intercepted the express delivery, resulting in the return of the package.<br>Tiktok, who was unhappy, came to the shaking platform to find out the problem of the artificial customer service, but the way of dealing with the other side was not satisfactory. He only proposed the way to compensate tens of dollars of coupons. Through this, Zhang kept hesitating about shopping on the tiktok platform.<br>Meanwhile, Li Hong, who sold ceramic products on the shaking platform, received 6 tiktok notices in 9 days. The reasons for the violation were the exception of the express order or express logistics track uploaded to the background.<br>Li Hong’s shop was also punished accordingly. A total of 4000 yuan of deposit and 30 points of store credit were deducted. The shop was closed for three days.<br>In this regard, Li Hong felt very aggrieved. After all the orders in the store were real delivery, repeatedly communicated with the customer service to ask how to appeal, and applied for a sealed certificate from the logistics network, the appeal still ended in failure.<br>Up to now, Li Hong still cannot accept the above punishment.<br>An independent e-commerce department was established in 618 in 2020, followed by the external chain removal activity; And then tiktok payment on-line, shaking tiktok completes the payment closed loop; And even put forward the concept of interest in electricity providers, impact trillion GMV, the voice of the voice tiktok into a public eye in a vigorous gesture.<br>But now, whether or not it is admitted, logistics has gradually become the Achilles heel of the tiktok electric provider.<br>Tiktok itself is aware of this. Official data show that the distribution of service delivery problems in the tiktok and the express delivery service account for more than 50%.<br>In addition, the problem of terminal delivery can directly affect the user shopping experience, and will further affect the user’s repeat purchase. It will have a negative impact on businesses and users. This may be partly because of the fact that the chattering has been a tight lipped answer to the tiktok rate.<br>Tiktok, however, is considered to be generally weaker than expected in the near term.<br>Tiktok, raise a Babel of criticism of the noisy service, the company will provide door-to-door delivery, terminal delivery, terminal complaints, parcel priority transfer, exclusive service and other benefits.<br>Through these measures, tiktok intention reduces the rate of complaint and reversion rate of consumers.<br>According to snow leopard financial services, at present, Yin Zun Da is still in the water trial state. The voice only recommends that merchants buy some Yin Yin for some orders, and the recommended proportion is no more than 3% of the tiktok per day.<br>It should be noted that in this link, although the shaking is raising the importance of the terminal delivery, the initiative of the business lies in the business. In fact, whether the service premium is borne by the tiktok, whether the subsidy is transferred to the consumers, or whether the business platform will be transferred to consumers, needs further observation.<br>More importantly tiktok is essentially a service launched by tiktok and express delivery companies such as Zhong Tong, Tantong, rhyme, etc., and the jitter only plays a role in resource integration, and its intervention capability on the express platform is weak, and the effectiveness needs to be tested.</p>

After the group visit, President Kang Zeyu said that at present, the voice business is not doing warehousing, logistics, nor has it planned to build warehousing and logistics itself.<br>But Kang Zeyu’s denial cannot stand up in the face of facts.<br>Today, on the official recruitment website, there are 74 positions related to “logistics”, including R &amp; D, operation, product and functional positions, involving e-commerce supply chain, logistics middle office and other fields.<br>For rookie tiktok, logistics is very necessary, but there are rookie and Jingdong pearl Yu in front:<br>The former is positioned as a social logistics integrator based on Alibaba retail platform, which complements an important link in Alibaba’s performance network by integrating express companies and route transportation enterprises;<br>The latter is positioned as an integrated logistics service provider, which has established its own supply chain service advantages in the mode of warehouse distribution, and user experience has become its core competitiveness.<br>Therefore, “copying homework” has become a ready-made shortcut.<br>In May 2021, according to Tech planet, the voice and electricity business of logistics tiktok came to many former P9 supply chain &#x2F; logistics personnel. The new ones who left the company from Ali were Wang Wei, Ou Liyong, He Chuan.<br>Rookie tiktok logistics business is coming to the rookie logistics as it is visible after the P talent is coming.<br>Tiktok, tiktok, tiktok tiktok, a video of the voice of the business platform, was circulated online on the beginning of August. The screenshots showed that the sound of the quiver will be fully encrypted from August 1st.<br>As the initiator of electronic face list, Alibaba led many express companies to establish a logistics service provider “rookie network” in 2013. In May of the next year, all express companies accepted the public electronic face list platform launched by rookie network.<br>Of course, Jingdong and pinduoduo have also launched their own electronic face lists in the follow-up. Therefore, this measure can be regarded as a standard configuration to protect users’ data privacy.<br>However, what deserves more attention is the capital layout of byte itself in the field of logistics.<br>On August 25, 2021, byte established two logistics companies, one named Shanghai Daoqu Yuedong Logistics Technology Co., Ltd. and the other is Shanghai Xingchen Yuedong Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. their business scope is related to goods warehousing services supervised by the customs.<br>In the first few days of the same month, byte invested in zongteng group, a global cross-border e-commerce infrastructure service provider, which mainly provides overseas warehousing and other services for cross-border e-commerce merchants.<br>In addition, it also invested in three logistics robot Enterprises: Jiazhi technology, future robot and syrius Juxing.<br>On the one hand, it is internal incubation, on the other hand, it is investment at the same time, which is similar to the logic of rookie’s asset layout - self support as a supplement, investment as the main, investment in major logistics enterprises, layout of warehouses, and mastering the big data of sales and logistics.<br>Rookie’s tiktok network is more likely to rely on the Internet mode of rookie if it takes into account the recent market crazy “tiktok” has completed the investment in the rabbit express, and the integrated voice service of the United States express company.<br>This seems to be in line with the mainstream thinking. For the tiktok electricity supplier, if it imitates Jingdong logistics, it is undoubtedly very difficult. Jingdong Logistics asset construction costs a lot. In order to implement the logistics construction idea of integrating Jingdong warehouse and equipment, the volume of Jingdong fixed assets and projects under construction is different from that of general logistics enterprises.<br>But Kwai Kwai Kwai logistics has been ahead of the tiktok, Zhang Yipeng, who was responsible for the sales center of the fast hand business in January 2021, told the twenty-first Century economic report that “no quick self service supply chain planning is built in the short term.”<br>On the whole, the voice business is trying to make up the logistics puzzle, which is a tiktok question. But the answer it gives is slightly old-fashioned and childish.<br>(all characters in the text are pseudonyms)<br>reference material:<br>Snow leopard financial services tiktok’s logistics disease: last mile of the fire<br>Tech planet “exclusive voice tiktok personnel Transformation: domestic and international zoning management, introducing Ali high P overweight supply chain”<br>This article is from the official account of WeChat, ID:baoliaohui.

          <p>Truth social, a social media company founded by former US President trump, officially launched in Apple’s App Store late Sunday. From the software interface released by users, the user interface style of truth social is very similar to that of twitter. The bottom bar has four functions: information flow, search, private message and message. In the personal page, there are three dynamic categories: truth, truth and reply, and media, which correspond to Twitter’s tweets, tweets, replies, and media respectively.<br>From the pictures released by netizens, we can see that the number of registered people exceeded 100000 shortly after the opening of download. One night later, on Monday morning, the app surpassed HBO max, tiktok, youtube, instagram and Facebook to become the top 1 app download in Apple store. However, truth social encountered difficulties on the release date. Some users were unable to register, and some users received error messages. But for others who subscribe to the app, it will be automatically downloaded to their Apple device.<br>Related stocks dwac phun<br>Trump uses the platform as a substitute for social media giants twitter (Code: TWTR), Facebook (Code: FB) and Youtube (GOOG, Googl). On January 6, 2021, Trump’s Twitter, Facebook and tubing accounts were permanently blocked after Trump’s supporters caused riots in the US Capitol.<br>Trump media and Technology Group (tmtg), the venture capital company behind truth social, is led by Devon Nunes, a former Republican congressman in the United States. Nunes said on February 20: “our goal is to fully operate in the United States at least by the end of March. I think we can achieve this goal.”<br>Although the source of funds of the company is unclear, tmtg plans to be listed in New York through merger with spac digital world acquisition (Code: dwac). Upon completion of the transaction, it will receive $293 million in cash held by dwac in the trust, less any shareholder redemption. Last December, tmtg also raised $1 billion in committed financing from private investors, which will be put into use after the completion of the dwac transaction.<br>As part of the partnership signed in December, rumble will provide video and streaming services to true social. Rumble has always been regarded as a substitute for Google’s YouTube. Rumble’s investors include famous conservative venture capitalists J.D. Vance and Peter Thiel.<br>Truth social can only be used on Apple’s IOS system. Users in the UK and other countries are told that they cannot use the app in their region.<br>The logo of this application has also attracted the attention of trail, a small sustainable transportation company in the UK, which is investigating the similarities between the brand of truth social and its own brand.<br>A spokesman for the UK company said by email: “trail has no affiliation or contact with the truth social website.

          <p>(Li Yipeng)<br>The continuous emergence of new crown transmission makes nucleic acid detection become people’s “Daily”. In addition to the routine hospital laboratory, many people are also exposed to ICL (independent clinical laboratory) for the first time due to nucleic acid testing.<br>As a “behind the scenes” link in the medical industry chain, ICL has come to the front because of the new crown. In the process of expanding from b-end to C-end, digitization has become a necessity.<br>ICL was first born in the United States in 1925. With the increasing demand for medical testing and the increasing number of testing items, hospitals alone can not meet the needs in terms of testing efficiency and types. Independent medical laboratories with outsourced testing services as the core help medical institutions improve testing efficiency through large-scale operation.<br>In the medical insurance reform in the 1980s, ICL achieved rapid development due to its significant cost-effective advantages. According to public data, in 2018, the ICL market penetration in Japan reached 67%, Europe 50% and the United States 35%.<br>In China’s medical field dominated by public hospitals, the non-profit business nature and institutional factors make most of the tests still completed by the laboratory department in the hospital, so the penetration rate of ICL is only 5%. This not only shows that ICL still has broad market space, but also means that the traditional model of serving hospitals alone is difficult to achieve rapid growth.<br>Dean diagnostics, founded in 2001, is one of the main players in the field of ICL in China. Its business scope covers diagnostic services, sales of diagnostic products, technology R &amp; D and production, health management, cold chain logistics, judicial expertise, cro and other fields.<br>After the call of “all tests should be done, and all tests are willing” was put forward in April 2020, Dean diagnostics spent seven days to build a 1200 square meter “Reddy” rapid testing laboratory that can detect 70000 cases a day, raising the single day testing of its Hangzhou headquarters to 100000 cases a day. According to the data released in July 2020, the amount of nucleic acid detection undertaken by Dean diagnosis after the outbreak accounted for one tenth of the national total at that time.<br>While undertaking social responsibility, “war epidemic” gives Dean diagnosis the opportunity to directly face the public with testing needs. However, for a company that has always been facing the b-end market in recent 20 years, it is not easy to join to C service.<br>In the previous testing outsourcing services, ICL institutions only need to arrange regular door-to-door collection and delivery of samples, laboratory testing and remote delivery of reports. The business process is short and the number of customers is small, which makes the process docking and service difficulty of to B business relatively controllable.<br>However, in the c-end-oriented testing service, it is not only necessary to build a testing site, but also the institutions must be responsible for the testing appointment, information registration, report push and other processes, which has increased the complexity several times.<br>Prior to this, Dean diagnostics, like many national companies, had the situation that the IT systems and data of the group and local branches were not interconnected and partially relied on manual forms. When facing a large number of C-end customers, the ability of data flow, management and service has become the biggest bottleneck.<br>Digitization is therefore a must.<br>In 2020, Dean diagnostics introduced the CRM system based on SaaS mode and connected it with OA, MDM (Master Data Management), LIMS (Laboratory Management), customer service, decision-making, finance and other systems to realize the integrated management of internal data of the enterprise.<br>This not only ensures the service efficiency, but also greatly improves the original service-oriented ability. The service processes and test data of b-end customers such as hospitals, CDC and physical examination institutions have been integrated and precipitated, and the efficiency of information flow has been improved, so that patients can receive test reports earlier and start diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.<br>Another urgent gap is customer service.<br>Compared with b-end services, C-end users have more consulting demands. After starting to provide testing services to the public, the number of telephone consultations for Dean diagnosis has increased several times. The sporadic outbreak in 2021 increased the pressure on the customer service team.<br>To this end, Dean diagnostics also introduced the full scene intelligent customer service system udesk under vofeng technology to respond to users’ common problems faster in the way of AI robots.<br>In addition to integrating external technologies, Dean diagnostics is also constantly building its own digital capability, and on this basis, it will expand to C services beyond New Crown detection.<br>In May 2020, Dean diagnostics launched the third-party online Internet inspection platform “Xiaofei inspection”, which directly faces the C-end users, and provided the supply chain, information, diagnostic services, products and channels originally built for medical institutions to the public.<br>Based on the “Xiaofei test” platform, C-end users can independently make an appointment for more than 60 test items, such as hpv23 genotyping gene test for women, accurate screening of AMH ovarian function and early screening of colorectal cancer, covering the whole population of women, men, children and the elderly.<br>At the celebration of the first anniversary of Xiaofei inspection, Chen Haibin, chairman of Dean diagnostics, evaluated this service platform facing the C-end as an important part of digital reform. CEO Huang Baixing said at the event that to C business will become the third most important growth curve of Dean diagnosis after general inspection and special inspection.<br>While supporting new services, digitization is also becoming a breakthrough for Dean’s diagnostic to B business.<br>In November 2021, Dean diagnostics announced the launch of the laboratory management system iris LIMS. Compared with the traditional inspection information system, the management of iris LIMS covers all elements such as people, instruments, materials (reagent consumables, etc.), processes, data (detection methods, laboratory links) and can support hundreds of thousands of samples and thousands of people in chain laboratories to cooperate across regions at the same time.<br>In the same month, Dean diagnosis was recognized by the Department of science and technology of Zhejiang Province and selected into the “Key Laboratory of digital medical diagnosis technology of Zhejiang Province”. Years of data accumulation will also provide assistance for the breakthrough of diagnostic technology.<br>With the per capita GDP exceeding 10000 US dollars, the medical demand in the Chinese market will change from “quantity” to “quality”, and better medical experience will become the inevitable direction. Whether in the user service experience layer or the technological breakthrough itself, there has been a digital figure.<br>At the strategic level, Dean diagnosis has set itself the goal of “industrial digitization and digital industrialization”. Chen Haibin, chairman of Dean diagnostics, said at the “Dean day” in 2021 that in the future, collecting samples from hospitals, laboratory testing and providing diagnostic solutions around disease diagnosis and clinical connection should be combined with the application of AI, artificial intelligence and other digital technologies.<br>“The future of Dean diagnosis must be a medical big data company. We will receive a large number of samples every day. How to use massive data to create infinite value for customers is what we need to study and realize in the future.” Chen Haibin said.</p>

          <p>The Beijing Winter Olympics has come to a perfect end, and people are still talking about the “legend” of the Winter Olympics.<br>In addition to the athletes who have repeatedly achieved good results, the biggest winners this year are the sponsors and brands that invite athletes to speak for them. With Su Yiming’s victory last week, “Yuanqi forest won hemp” once rushed to the hot search. The reason behind it is that the three spokesmen signed by Yuanqi forest won the championship at the Winter Olympics.<br>In this regard, Yuanqi forest ridiculed itself as “blessed”, and took the opportunity to open a limited edition beverage lottery, which successfully filled the marketing atmosphere.<br>What benefits did the vigorous forest of “winning the bet” get in this event?</p>

The new spokesman, Yiyang Qianxi, signed the new year’s signing of the two films, including the water gate bridge of the long Jin lake and the “miracle kid”. It has earned the market attention. In the first new year’s drama, the “yuan C” is the “Yuan”. The sports stars who successively signed at the end of last year detonated hot spots at the Winter Olympics. A series of performances make people sigh and wonder: why is Yuanqi forest so lucky all the time?<br>No one is a born gambler, and vitality forest is no exception. The so-called good luck is nothing more than “survivor bias”.<br>As an emerging beverage consumer brand, Yuanqi forest can become popular in a short time, which can be understood as the result of its massive investment in marketing. In recent years, we can see the action of yuancao on various social platforms, such as the micro blog and variety show.<br>In addition to online channels, offline channels such as elevator advertising, offline small event sponsors and convenience store freezers are also key strategic targets of Yuanqi forest. The net is wide enough to catch some shining fish.<br>But the vitality forest is not blindly casting a net. On the contrary, its purpose is very clear. From the beginning, the target customers of Yuanqi forest are white-collar workers and generation Z young people. Therefore, it will try its best in marketing.<br>For example, under the pressure of fast-paced life, young people prefer to watch variety shows online. Variety shows and online dramas have become the first goal of Yuanqi forest sponsorship. Variety shows such as “a string of life” and “a vigorous brother” are based on this logic. On the choice of spokesperson, the yuan forest also favored the new generation and national high stars, such as Chen Feiyu, Yiyang Qianxi, Gu Ailing and so on.<br>At the beginning of 2021, Yuanqi forest won the sponsorship right of station B Spring Festival Gala with 150 million yuan, realizing the leap of station B fans from 0 to 1.5 million. Although Yuanqi forest has been criticized by the outside world for its large marketing investment, it can be said that almost every penny of its investment has been shown to consumers.<br>By the end of 2020, the sales of Yuanqi forest reached 2.7 billion yuan. The sales growth rates in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 300%, 200% and 309% respectively, which was very amazing.<br>However, in 2022, the “gambling luck” of Yuanqi forest may not be so good.</p>

It is said that there will be “no more” vitality forest in the market in 2022.<br>Whether the news is true or false, a more obvious phenomenon is that in recent years, Yuanqi forest has put pressure on many established beverage enterprises in the market.<br>The concept of “0 sugar, 0 fat, 0 calorie” health drink created by Yuanqi forest has rapidly become a trend in the context of new consumption. In its explosive growth in 2020, many established beverage enterprises such as Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, nongnongshan spring and Wahaha also tried to launch the same type of bubble water, but with little effect. In this track developed by Yuanqi forest, Yuanqi forest seems to have the absolute initiative.<br>Beverage giants are obviously unwilling to see this situation. Therefore, in 2021, many OEM factories of Yuanqi forest had to choose to shut down under pressure, which once caused Yuanqi forest to encounter a capacity crisis. Nowadays, Yuanqi forest has made greater efforts to invest in self built factories, and the lack of production capacity has played a great role in promoting it.<br>It is undeniable that since the vitality forest temporarily emerged, the beverage giants have implemented almost all-round encirclement and interception, and the latter has been struggling to survive. Obviously, in 2022, the pressure from the giants will rise to a higher level. Can the vitality forest resist it?<br>At the end of last year, Yuanqi forest disclosed some business data for the first time: as of September, the company’s R &amp; D cost had increased by 350% year-on-year. In the past 12 months, more than 30 kinds of beverage flavors have been added, and the average product R &amp; D cycle is 5.5 months.<br>It can be seen that Yuanqi forest has not stopped its R &amp; D. on the contrary, its R &amp; D investment is still increasing year by year. Besides upgrading in taste and other aspects, product lines are also extending. Now, it involves many kinds of bubbles, such as bubble water, milk tea, tea drink, functional beverage, coffee, light food Baijiu and liquor.<br>Rich SKUs make Yuanqi forest more likely to resist risks. However, it is worth noting that bubble water is still the main source of sales revenue of Yuanqi forest. If the weight of other products cannot be improved, it will be one of the hidden dangers of Yuanqi forest.<br>In addition to paying attention to the product itself, in terms of market expansion, Yuanqi forest also made a plan to go to sea early. At the end of 2021, Yuanqi forest said that in mid December, its overseas aluminum can bubble water broke into the top 10 of Amazon bubble water best seller list in the United States. At present, the products of Yuanqi forest have landed in more than 40 countries and regions, and the sea strategy has achieved initial results.<br>As a young emerging brand, Yuanqi forest does have many shortcomings, and its enterprise heritage can not compete with beverage giants. However, the emergence of vitality forest has exploded a thunder in the almost solidified bottled beverage market, just like a catfish reactivating the market.<br>The beverage industry needs fresh blood, which is the law of market development. Even if there is no “vitality forest”, other new consumer brands will launch an impact. The “encirclement, pursuit and interception” of the vitality forest by beverage giants is not only the maintenance of their own interests, but also the embodiment of their failure to timely understand the potential development trend of the market.<br>Although it is certain that the life of Yuanqi forest will not be so “easy” in 2022, the pressure from giants is difficult to hurt the root, and Yuanqi forest still has room for growth.<br>This article is from WeChat official account “Xiao Qian note” (ID:xiaoqianshuo), 36 krypton authorized release.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods are becoming more and more “luxury”.<br>In February 16th, Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury brand, once again called “LV”, has increased its price in Louis Weedon.<br>According to several media statistics, the official prices of LV classic capsules and Neverfull are 46500 yuan and 12000 yuan respectively. According to Lv’s official website, the prices of these two handbags have risen to 52000 yuan and 14400 yuan respectively, up 11.8% and 20% respectively. The price of another Mini pochette accessories rose 54% from 3500 yuan to 5400 yuan.<br>In this regard, after multi-party verification, fuel finance and economics learned that at present, the prices of LV related styles have increased in the Chinese market. For another round of price increase of luxury goods, some netizens joked, “if the price increases by 10%, will it save 110% if you don’t buy it?” Some netizens said, “people who buy LV bags won’t care about the 10% price increase.”<br>But for another price rise of LV, more consumers said they would not affect their purchase. Chaochao, a partner of a law firm in Beijing, is a loyal consumer of luxury goods, with an annual luxury consumption of 100000-300000 yuan.<br>Chaochao doesn’t care whether the price of luxury goods rises or not. “Luxury goods will adjust the price for several times every year. Now my attitude towards luxury goods tends to be rational. I will basically go shopping after signing a big order every time. I will have my own budget and taste preferences. The price rise will not directly affect whether I buy or not.”<br>The price rise of LV is confident. In 2021, despite the impact of the epidemic and the overall economic downturn, LVMH group (lvmuy. US), the parent company of LV, still achieved significant growth. According to the financial data for the whole year of 2021 released by LVMH group on January 27 this year, the annual operating revenue of LVMH group in 2021 was 64.22 billion euros, an increase of 44% over 2020 and 20% over 2019 before the outbreak of the epidemic, completely exceeding the revenue of 62.21 billion euros expected by analysts.<br>In addition, the annual operating profit margin of LVMH group reached 26.7%, an increase of 8% and 5% respectively compared with 2020 and 2019; Operating cash flow exceeded 13 billion euros, an increase of 121% and 119% respectively over 2020 and 2019. The high operating income and cash flow reflect LVMH group’s unshakable position as the “overlord” of luxury goods.<br>Data source: lvmh2021 financial data<br>In fact, more than LV, from last winter to the beginning of this spring, many luxury brands have completed the action of price increase.<br>In January this year, Chanel raised the price of some styles again on the basis of the price increase in November last year. Among them, the price of coco handle will increase by 2000 yuan, and the price of package types such as businessaffinity and Le boy will increase by 8-12%. Chanel has risen as much as 60% in the past three years.<br>The price increase of herm è s is basically fixed in January every year, and the price increase range of each model ranges from 500-4300 yuan. Lindy Mini rose from 46500 yuan to 48700 yuan, an increase of 4.7%; Verrou 21 rose 6.7% from 63550 yuan to 67850 yuan.<br>Behind the price rise is the recovery of the revenue of these luxury brands after the epidemic. In 2021, L’Oreal Group’s sales increased by 16.1% year-on-year to 32.28 billion euros, while its operating profit reached a record 6.16 billion euros, up 18.3% year-on-year, both exceeding the pre epidemic level. In the first half of 2021, Hermes group’s total sales reached 4.235 billion euros, an increase of 77% over the same period in 2020 and 33% over the same period in 2019.<br>The younger generation is becoming the main force of luxury goods. According to the 2021 luxury brand value report launched by brand France, a British brand evaluation agency, millennials contribute more than 80% of the purchasing power to luxury income. According to BCG statistics, among Chinese luxury consumers in 2021, the post-80s accounted for only 7%, while the post-90s and post-00s accounted for 50%.<br>The addition of generation Z has brought changes to the pattern of luxury consumer groups, and the pursuit of personality and consumption experience has also affected the layout of luxury marketing. In recent years, luxury brands are increasingly inclined to “please” young people in terms of product design, marketing and sales channels.<br>Will the price rise of luxury goods that try to please young people against the current economic environment have an impact on future sales? Many market participants believe that from past experience, the price rise will drain some consumers with insufficient consumption level of luxury goods, but it will not affect the rise of their revenue and net profit, but will help the brand to screen users in reverse.<br>Li Yingtao, research director of Analysys brand retail industry, told fuel finance that after the price rise, even if the sales volume of luxury goods will be affected to some extent, the probability of revenue and profit will still rise. “Some more pragmatic and rational young people may reduce their purchases after the price rise, but it will not affect loyal consumers who buy luxury goods because of class symbols.”<br>Lai Yang, executive vice president of the Beijing Institute of business economics, also said, “the appreciation of classic models is a means to preserve the value of luxury products. New designs and iterations attract young people, and old products cannot fall in price, so they continue to attract relatively conservative consumers.”</p>
<h3 id="Who-is-buying-LV"><a href="#Who-is-buying-LV" class="headerlink" title="Who is buying LV?"></a>Who is buying LV?</h3><p>Every important festival, luxury stores never lack consumers.<br>On the afternoon of Valentine’s day on February 14, there was a long line at the gates of Louis Vuitton, Dior, channel, Celine and other brands of Beijing SKP and ITC, as in previous years.<br>Fuel finance and economics observed that the queuing consumers showed a younger trend, and many of the consumers waiting at the door were young people aged about 30 or 20-25.<br>Photo &#x2F; Louis Vuitton Beijing international trade store source &#x2F; photo taken by finance and Economics<br>“Although I don’t buy it often, it’s OK to spend it occasionally.” The post-90s Lin Lin has an annual income of more than 100000 yuan. She will buy 1-2 luxury goods as planned every year. “I like to buy bags, especially the classic LV models.”<br>In Lin Lin’s view, consumption within his ability is not a waste. “If the price rises, it’s still an investment.” She smiled.<br>Unlike Lin Lin, chao chao’s consumption of luxury goods is more daily. The first time she spent tens of thousands of yuan on a bag was because of her work. “At the beginning of my work, I was responsible for some financial consulting and often had to visit some CFOs and CEOs. At that time, I was the youngest in the group and often went to see customers with canvas shoes and canvas bags.”<br>Later, the team leader said to Chao Chao, “don’t spend all your money on eating and drinking and buy a decent outfit. To make friends with customers, you should look like someone who can make friends with them.”<br>“I still remember when I wore a plaid shirt to buy Dior lady bag, my sales sister looked at me.” Chao chao smiled. “She must think I’m the kind of person who doesn’t eat and buy bags for two months. In fact, so am I. I really paid off my credit card for half a year.”<br>“Later, when I went shopping with customers, I gradually began to get in frequent contact with luxury goods. Now I can say the styles of almost every major brand. When breaking the ice with customers, there is nothing easier than talking about their watches and bags. Luxury goods, like variety shows and gossip, is a language and a signal: we pay attention to the same things and belong to the same world 。”<br>Because of the upgrading of the circle, Xingyu, who works in a large Internet factory in Hangzhou, also enters the luxury consumption brigade. Although he rarely buys luxury goods, he often buys gifts for his girlfriend, and spends 50000-100000 yuan on luxury goods every year. “I simply believe that it’s always right to buy expensive things within my ability.”<br>“Many young people in big internet factories around me have relatively high salaries and will receive six or seven digit year-end bonuses at the end of the year. Many of these people are not married and don’t have to raise children or houses, so when they get the money, they will buy luxury goods as their own reward for working in ‘996’.”<br>Shu Hua, a product manager who works in Shanghai, also enters the luxury circle because of material upgrading after work. Her annual consumption of luxury goods is 100000-200000 yuan.<br>Shuhua doesn’t pay attention to the brand when buying luxury goods. She pays more attention to the design style and shopping experience. “I seldom shop online. I basically shop offline. I like the quality and attitude of store service very much. Even if I like the style I like online, I will try it offline. This shopping experience is more enjoyable for me than shopping itself.”<br>According to the 2021 Kwai Luxe industry data report, luxury goods consumption trends in Shuangfeng. The 18-23 year old Z generation and the 41-49 year old crowd are also the main force of luxury consumption. The 2021 luxury industry report released by Deloitte also pointed out that the luxury consumption of generation Z showed an obvious growth trend, and said that the love of generation Z for luxury goods is likely to be affected by the consumption behavior of their parents.<br>Source &#x2F; massive engine<br>Kiki, born in 1997, is such a girl. Kiki, who lives in the northeast, went shopping with her mother since childhood, “At that time, there was no concept of famous brand, and there was no concept of whether it was expensive or not. I only knew whether it was good or not. Because my mother liked LV, I naturally had feelings for the brand. However, after college, I began to prefer Celine. Some styles of LV were not personalized enough. Luxury goods were just consumables for me. Therefore, I was more interested in the value or preservation of the brand or product Value your preferences, sense of design and sense of fashion. “<br>Kiki represents the psychology of generation Z luxury consumers. According to the report “new faces of Chinese luxury” released by orvey data, the number of generation Z who buy luxury goods will buy the popular models of the season rather than the classic ones with value preservation is twice that of consumers over the age of 35.<br>According to orvey data, 40% of generation Z are willing to invest more in luxury consumption, of which more than 18% accept to invest one-fifth of their income in luxury consumption. These young people weaken the symbolism of luxury goods and emphasize the pursuit of a sense of design, personalization and experience. Catering to the mental trend of these consumers has become a new challenge for luxury goods.</p>
<h3 id="Luxury-goods-“please”-young-people"><a href="#Luxury-goods-“please”-young-people" class="headerlink" title="Luxury goods “please” young people"></a>Luxury goods “please” young people</h3><p>With the younger and younger consumer groups, these luxury brands need to “please” young people more and more. Since the 1990s, when luxury goods entered China, they have continuously upgraded their design and marketing, and “please” young people with all kinds of tricks.<br>Before 2015, due to the lack of advantages in domestic purchasing power, the full popularity of social media and the traffic is not in the golden age, the brand marketing communication in this period generally followed the traditional straight-line thinking of the luxury industry from top to bottom. At that time, the purchasing power of major luxury goods in China still valued the significance of their class symbols. The design of luxury goods was mainly formal clothes, with little addition of Chinese elements.<br>After 2015, due to the exponential growth of the purchasing power of luxury goods in the Chinese market and the popularity of the Internet and we media, luxury goods began to be younger and upgraded.<br>In 2018, Dior opened its tiktok account and became the first luxury item to eat crab. Subsequently, in 2019 and 2020, Dior successively settled in xiaohongshu, station B and tmall.<br>While in-depth traffic marketing, Dior began to choose China as the important and even the first show of its big show. On April 12, 2021, the release show of Dior 2021 autumn ready to wear series was held in Shanghai. The show was broadcast live on multiple platforms that night, and the cumulative number of viewers exceeded 120 million.<br>Dior’s successful communication with the Chinese market makes it the most resistant luxury brand under the epidemic. Erwan rambourg, an analyst at HSBC, estimates that Dior’s sales reached 6.28 billion euros in 2021, contributing 10% of LVMH’s total revenue and 13% of the group’s profit. According to the latest financial data of LVMH, the sales volume of Dior’s fashion leather Department reached 30.996 billion euros in 2021, an increase of 47% over the same period in 2020 and a strong increase of 42% compared with 2019.<br>Dior’s success once again confirms the power of China’s luxury consumption. Tiktok, the LVMH group’s LV, followed by the jitter platform, and its official account fans exceeded 1 million 440 thousand by February 21, 2022.<br>On November 17, 2021, LV selected Shanghai as the spring and summer women’s clothing show in 2022. This is the second time that LV has held a physical show in China after the epidemic, and it is the first time that the brand has brought the show of Nicolas ghesqui è re, director of women’s clothing art, to Chinese consumers.<br>Compared with the Dior show, LV added Chinese elements to the design and further deepened targeted marketing. The show showed 19 sets of brand-new design shapes specially designed for the Chinese market. Loop handbag, one of the exclusive handbags, showed the “scarf printing” composed of Lv’s iconic gold chain and leather belt.<br>Boldly breaking through the formal style, the design with the theme of fantasy, space travel and casual formal dress has attracted more young people’s attention. The total viewing volume of big show videos exceeds 160 million, and the reading volume of #lv spring and summer 22 women’s wear show # topics on microblog is 1.54 billion. Fashion media person Wu Ling commented on the design of women’s clothes at the show as “exquisite relaxation” in the article “the appearance of the ideal Wardrobe”.<br>Chinese elements and the limited design of leisure trend have also become a “big move” for luxury goods to seize the minds of young people.<br>In 2022, Valentino and Balenciaga successively launched the year of the tiger limited edition. Valentino 1967 series launched tops and handbags with pink and black stripes as the visual focus; Paris World launched an oversize coat that imitates tiger skin stripes. After the launch of the two exclusive models, they quickly attracted attention. Beijing SKP has little red book fashion bloggers to try them on almost every day, and the avant-garde design has attracted a large number of student party messages and inquiries.<br>After the design iteration, luxury goods have played fancy marketing.<br>In the past, luxury goods too described ancient and long-standing brand stories, such as the division and civil war of Gucci family, chanel and her lover, etc. these mysterious and gossip stories captured the first batch of luxury goods buyers’ longing for foreign life, but failed to move the heart of generation Z. Young people prefer bold, unconventional and fresh marketing to stereotypes that cannot be investigated.<br>In September 2021, Prada, who released a large advertising blockbuster in autumn and winter, settled in Shanghai Wuzhong market, which really let the market feel the breath of Prada’s life at a close distance. The appearance of the vegetable market is full of Prada’s main visual elements in the season. The dishes are wrapped in Prada’s environmental protection paper bags. The vegetable market is called “half a gathering place of Shanghai KOL” by xiaohongshu users.<br>Figure &#x2F; source of Prada Shanghai Wuzhong market &#x2F; screenshot of Xiaohong shuran finance and Economics<br>Gucci is actively trying in the field of social marketing. In 2020, Gucci will use circle of friends advertising to become the first luxury goods to send red envelopes in China. In the Spring Festival of 2022, the red envelope on the cover limited by Gucci and Doraemon was “opened” more than 30 million times in two weeks. It went online for two hours and rushed to the hot search with 210 million readings, successfully breaking the circle. After the Spring Festival, the average daily number of “dismantling” red envelopes remained at 36% of the activity period, bringing a long-term exposure effect to the brand.<br>LV arranges different online applets according to different user segments, including LV squared series experience stores in early spring of 2022 classified by season, men’s limited time stores in spring and summer, furniture hard box stores and new product experience stores classified by product category, and sneakers store for post-90s trendy men.<br>“For Louis Vuitton, wechat mall is not regarded as a single sales channel, but a part of the overall brand experience and retail ecosystem built by LV in China,” said the senior vice president of digital Asia of LVMH in the digital trend report of China’s luxury market<br>“China’s luxury market is very diversified, and the consumption preferences of different customers vary greatly. Therefore, we create all kinds of small programs to connect with different customer groups with their unique styles and contents. At the same time, these small programs have different ways of entry, but they always’ appear when you need it ‘, so as to provide customers with convenient and ultimate shopping experience to the greatest extent.”<br>The upgrading of design and marketing is nothing more than making an article on the “sense of experience”. Luxury goods firmly grasp the contempt of generation Z for “class” and “face”, pay attention to the satisfaction and freshness of consumption, and fully “take care” of generation Z consumers, which is also the foundation for the rise of luxury prices.</p>
<h3 id="Will-luxury-goods-“lose-powder”-after-the-price-rise"><a href="#Will-luxury-goods-“lose-powder”-after-the-price-rise" class="headerlink" title="Will luxury goods “lose powder” after the price rise?"></a>Will luxury goods “lose powder” after the price rise?</h3><p>In the economic environment is still in the doldrums, will the price rise of luxury goods that try to please young people once again affect the loyalty of consumers? The answer is No.<br>As for the price rise of luxury goods, Kiki said that this is also an old saying. “The reason for each price adjustment is that raw materials are expensive, imports and exports are expensive, etc. I am not very sensitive to prices. I mainly look at the style, whether it is suitable and whether I like it or not.”<br>Shuhua also said that the price increase will not affect their buying habits. “I have no car or house in Shanghai. I belong to the type of people who enjoy themselves in a hurry. If I have money, I don’t spend much. Therefore, I will start when I encounter what I like after the price increase. However, I certainly have the upper limit of price expectation and won’t let myself go to the point of not eating, drinking, buying bags and jewelry.”<br>Li Yingtao said that this is a normal market behavior, “The inflation caused by currency excess, the imbalance of the supply chain caused by the epidemic, and the supply chain shock caused by anti globalization are all the reasons for the rise in the price of luxury goods. The regular rise in the price of luxury goods is just like the rise in the price of our daily consumer goods, but because of the brand effect, their price rise will be greater and attract more attention.”<br>In fact, this is not the first time that LV has raised its price. According to public reports and statistics, LV has adjusted its price four times in October 2019, January 2020, September 2020 and January 2021. Netizens joked, “a bag has increased by 95% a year, which is higher than my fund.”<br>In the past two years, luxury goods have increased year by year, or even n has become the unspoken rule of the brand.<br>From the previous financial data released by LVMH, the price rise did not make it “lose powder”.<br>In 2020, due to the impact of the epidemic, the total revenue of LVMH decreased by 22% from 53.67 billion euros in 2019 to 44.65 billion euros, while the total revenue in 2021 was 64.22 billion euros, a year-on-year increase of 44%. It can be seen that the two price increases in 2020 have not affected consumers’ preference for luxury goods.<br>The increased unit price and revenue have greatly increased the group’s recurring operating profit and net profit. In 2021, the group’s recurring operating profit was 17.151 billion euros and its net profit was 12.698 billion euros; Year on year growth of 106.51% and 156.27% respectively in 2020.<br>Data source &#x2F; lvmh2021 financial data<br>In the Asian region dominated by China, the preference for leather bags and fashion bracelets is particularly obvious. In the financial report, LVMH’s income from fashion and leather products in 2021 increased by 47% year-on-year compared with that in 2020, reaching 8.964 billion euros.

          <p>Under Amazon’s “store closure tide”, another cross-border e-commerce has been refinanced.<br>Recently, sea home brand newme announced the completion of millions of dollars of angel + round financing, which is exclusively invested by Huaying capital. This round of financing will be used for the R &amp; D and construction of private brands and the expansion of incremental channels.<br>This is newme’s third financing in less than a year. The first two are the seed round of millions of RMB invested by yunmu capital and Zhishi capital in January 2021, and the angel round of millions of dollars invested by the only capital and followed by Qingying venture capital in November 2021.<br>The goal is to become a “home version of sheen”. Does newme have a chance to replicate the success of sheen?</p>
<h3 id="Rooted-in-tiktok-live-broadcast-Gmv-exceeds-one-million-dollars-a-year"><a href="#Rooted-in-tiktok-live-broadcast-Gmv-exceeds-one-million-dollars-a-year" class="headerlink" title="Rooted in tiktok live broadcast, Gmv exceeds one million dollars a year"></a>Rooted in tiktok live broadcast, Gmv exceeds one million dollars a year</h3><p>Founded in November 2020, newme is a DTC overseas home brand. It takes the home demand groups in European and American markets as the target users and sells domestic “new, strange and special” home products to overseas markets by small package air transportation.<br>Newme mainly relies on tiktok channel to carry goods through tiktok’s short video advertising, combined with its own live broadcasting team and third-party agent broadcasting, and use tiktok stores and independent stations to undertake traffic to realize transformation and commodity sales.<br>Co founder Gu Jun introduced to China investment network that since the official sale in March 2021, newme has invested more than one million dollars in tiktok short video advertising, with a peak daily advertising revenue of more than 1000 orders and more than 10000 SKUs. More than 500 live broadcasts have been set up, and the live broadcast conversion rate of 1-2% has been realized. Based on the number of viewers per live broadcast of 3000-6000, an average of 50 or 60 orders have been converted per live broadcast. Since the second half of 2021, the monthly Gmv has doubled, with a peak of nearly US $1 million.<br>Newme also continues to make efforts at the supply chain end, and further defines new products through self-research, outsourcing and other ways. The main products include lamps, kitchen appliances, bathroom appliances and electric tools, and the customer unit price is maintained between $30-100.<br>Founder Gu Jun is a continuous entrepreneur in the e-commerce industry. He once worked in jd.com, lefeng.com and vipshop.<br>In 2015, Gu Jun founded a social e-commerce for imported beauty products, planted Japanese and Korean beauty products with the help of social platforms, and then imported and sold the products to China. The company has completed three rounds of financing and obtained the investment of Gu Jun’s former boss Li Jing, Jingwei China, Xianfeng Changqing and Bertelsmann respectively, with a total financing of nearly ten million US dollars.<br>With the rise of major social e-commerce companies such as pinduoduo, xiaohongshu and Yunji wechat stores, the market share of small and medium-sized companies was squeezed, and Gu Jun began to look for the next overseas opportunity.<br>Around 2018, Gu Jun took a fancy to the overseas B2B e-commerce market. He once started a local social e-commerce in India, similar to the Indian version of “Yunji micro store”, but soon the company encountered an epidemic and trade conflict between China and India, and Gu Jun had to “turn around”.<br>With his first two entrepreneurial experiences, Gu Jun quickly identified a new battlefield. In 2020, Gu Jun, who was in the United States, had an insight into the opportunity of the American market - during the epidemic, there was no offline retail in the United States, but online retail was hot. So Gu Jun quickly founded today’s newme.<br>Similar to Gu Jun, another co-founder Tan Jianrong is also a continuous entrepreneur. Tan Jianrong once lived in France for seven years and worked for Microsoft for two years. He founded 3C consumer electronics brand emie and received investment from many institutions such as Bertelsmann, blue lake capital and Jinglin capital, with a total financing of more than 100 million yuan.<br>At present, newme has more than 20 employees, most of whom have overseas study and work background, have good English language ability, and are familiar with overseas culture and living environment.</p>
<h3 id="Strive-for-“product-going-to-sea”-to-“brand-going-to-sea”"><a href="#Strive-for-“product-going-to-sea”-to-“brand-going-to-sea”" class="headerlink" title="Strive for “product going to sea” to “brand going to sea”"></a>Strive for “product going to sea” to “brand going to sea”</h3><p>At present, most of newme products are OEM or purchased by a third party. Next, we will focus more than 50% on the R &amp; D and construction of our own brands, establish differentiated competitive barriers, and strive to achieve a Gmv proportion of 30% - 40%.<br>This shift stems from the sales experience of an Emoji luminous mask. During the epidemic, newme showed a luminous Emoji mask in the tiktok live studio, selling 10000 pieces in just four days. But this product was not created by newme. It was sold by Amazon five years ago. At that time, the product had a general response. The live broadcast of newme made this mask popular and also gave those Amazon stores a “free ride”, receiving 30000 mask orders in a week.<br>This makes Gu Jun realize that only by building his own brand and increasing the scarcity of products, can we continuously improve the repurchase rate of consumers in newme, break through the bottleneck of “product going to sea” and realize “brand going to sea”.<br>In Gu Jun’s view, cross-border e-commerce will mostly experience business evolution from OEM to white brand and then to private brand. Newme plans to start from the front of the supply chain, redefine products and upgrade design to build its own brand through accurate user portraits.<br>Gu Jun admitted that one of newme’s learning objectives is the cross-border e-commerce platform sheen. Sheen has strong content production capacity and strong supply chain management ability, through the content high-frequency update of front-end traffic and the quick response of small orders in the back-end supply chain. As early as 2015-2018, sheen began to use technology to transform the supply chain and enable the factory Kanban and production management system to reduce inventory and improve the efficiency of the supply chain.<br>However, it is not easy to replicate the success of sheen. Damonstudio, a cross-border e-commerce independent station benchmarked to sheen under byte, recently announced the closure of website operations. Some cross-border e-commerce racetrack investors believe that there is a big gap between damonstudio and sheen in terms of new user recognition, business maturity and supply chain management, which is more like byte’s water test in cross-border e-commerce business. However, this will not stop byte people from looking for the next sheen, and cross-border e-commerce is also becoming a new battlefield for Internet manufacturers. As of January 2022, cross-border e-commerce financing has exceeded 100 million, including Sequoia and other head institutions.<br>In particular, after Amazon’s “store closure tide” not long ago, cross-border e-commerce independent stations quickly became popular, and coincidentally chose the live delivery mode of light capital to market in tiktok. Gu Jun also pointed out that with the popularity of overseas live broadcasting and goods carrying industry, overseas offline retail industry has also started online live broadcasting at the same time. Taking advantage of tiktok, newme will also face off with large supermarkets such as target and Costco.<br>Ji Wei, founding managing partner of Huaying capital, said that driven by the epidemic and other factors in recent years, overseas e-commerce has developed rapidly. The e-commerce of the traffic platform represented by tiktok will bring huge market space in the future. Newme is one of the first authorized sellers in China, which can realize closed-loop trading in tiktok station and has unique top allocation rights in its e-commerce system. Newme team has been deeply engaged in traffic e-commerce for many years. Both founders have more than ten years of Internet and retail entrepreneurship experience, have a deep understanding of supply chain and brand, and have strong traffic operation ability.<br>This article is from WeChat official account, ID:DsstCapital, and is published by Zhang Junwen, 36 krypton authorized by Dongsishitiao.</p>
